----- OMI 1.0.6.5

Added support for IPv6 HTTP communications.

Disabled support for SSL v1.x and v2.x because these are deemed insecure.

Added support for SSL certificates that vary from connection to connection by making the
name of the certificate and private key files a parameter to the connection rather than
having a fixed file name for each install.

Added support for reading SSL certificates and private keys in either .pem or .der format.

Added support for the HEAD request.

Added the LIKE keyword and "%" template matching to the WQL query compiler and execution
function.

Added support for the TOINSTANCE qualifier in the MOF compiler.

Removed reserved status of type names and qualifier names from the MOF compiler.
This enables property and class names to be the same as type and qualifier names.
This enables the common practice of using property declarations like "string String",
"string Class" and "uint32 Key".

Added support for initializing of array properties in MOF instances.

Revived support for the mofcxx, wqlcxx,
xmlcxx and httpclientcxx classes in the deprecated folder.

Fixed the unit tests in the deprecated/unittest folder.

Made the "class already declared" error a warning in the MOF compiler and enabled recognition of
the #pragma delete pragma in the MOF compiler. #pragma delete is ignored. This is a non-optimal
fix useful for the cases when a MOF file is sent with a #pragma delete followed by an identical
class definition.  This is used for targeting the MOF file at old and new installations that
may or may not have the MOF class already defined. The correct solution would be to
make the #pragma delete actually delete a class and the new class definition be loaded. This
would make the MOF compiler work with class structure changes also.

Added bison targets to the MOF and WQL GNUmakefiles. This is for those users that wish to
modify the parsers and that have Bison instead of Yacc installed on their development
computers. The compiled Yacc parsers are still included in the OMI distribution for those
that will not modify the parsers.

Added support for opening sockets whose special file path name is longer than
sizeof (struct sockaddr_un::sun_path) (usually 92 characters).
