    Description ( 
       "The PolicyRuleValidityPeriod aggregation represents scheduled "
       "activation and deactivation of a PolicyRule. If a PolicyRule "
       "is associated with multiple policy time periods via this "
       "association, then the Rule is active if at least one of the "
       "time periods indicates that it is active. (In other words, the "
       "PolicyTimePeriodConditions are ORed to determine whether the "
       "Rule is active.) A Time Period may be aggregated by multiple "
       "PolicyRules. A Rule that does not point to a "
       "PolicyTimePeriodCondition via this association is, from the "
       "point of view of scheduling, always active. It may, however, "
       "be inactive for other reasons. For example, the Rule\'s "
       "Enabled property may be set to \"disabled\" (value=2)." )]
