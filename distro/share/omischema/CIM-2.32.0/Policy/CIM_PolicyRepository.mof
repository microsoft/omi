    Description ( 
       "The term \'PolicyRepository\' has been confusing to both "
       "developers and users of the model. The replacement class name "
       "describes model element properly and is less likely to be "
       "confused with a data repository. \n"

       "A class representing an administratively defined container for "
       "reusable policy-related information. This class does not "
       "introduce any additional properties beyond those in its "
       "superclass AdminDomain. It does, however, participate in a "
       "number of unique associations. \n"
       "\n"
       "An instance of this class uses the NameFormat value "
       "\"PolicyRepository\"." )]
