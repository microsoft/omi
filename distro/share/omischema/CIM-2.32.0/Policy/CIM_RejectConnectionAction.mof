       "RejectConnectionAction is used to cause a connection or its "
       "negotiation to be terminated. For example, it can be used in "
       "conjunction with an address filter on UDP port 500 to reduce "
       "Denial of Service vulnerability. As another example, it can be "
       "specified as a low priority rule to explicitly define the "
       "default action for IKE key exchange negotiations - i.e., if "
       "the higher priority rules are not satisfied, then reject the "
       "connection negotiation." ),
