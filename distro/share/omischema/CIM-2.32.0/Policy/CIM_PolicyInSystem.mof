    Description ( 
       "CIM_PolicyInSystem is a generic association used to establish "
       "dependency relationships between Policies and the Systems that "
       "host them. These Systems may be ComputerSystems where Policies "
       "are \'running\' or they may be Policy Repositories where "
       "Policies are stored. This relationship is similar to the "
       "concept of CIM_Services being dependent on CIM_Systems as "
       "defined by the HostedService association. \n"
       "\n"
       "Cardinality is Max (1) for the Antecedent/System reference "
       "since Policies can only be hosted in at most one System "
       "context. Some subclasses of the association will further "
       "refine this definition to make the Policies Weak to Systems. "
       "Other subclasses of PolicyInSystem will define an optional "
       "hosting relationship. Examples of each of these are the "
       "PolicyRuleInSystem and PolicyConditionIn PolicyRepository "
       "associations, respectively." )]
