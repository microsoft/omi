    Description ( 
       "OSPFServiceConfiguration connects an OSPF service to its area "
       "configurations. The configurations are defined for the OSPF "
       "Service, and so do not make sense as stand alone objects. This "
       "is the reason for the Min (1), Max (1) cardinalities on "
       "OSPFService. They mandate the instantiation of the service and "
       "of this association for the referenced instance of "
       "OSPFAreaConfiguration. The area configuration acts as a focal "
       "point to bring together the router (indicated as a "
       "ComputerSystem with an instance of OSPFService, associated to "
       "the AreaConfiguration using this relationship), the area "
       "(indicated as an OSPFArea, associated to the AreaConfiguration "
       "using AreaOfConfiguration) and the address ranges for "
       "advertising (indicated as instances of RangeOfIPAddresses, "
       "associated to the AreaConfiguration using "
       "RangesOfConfiguration). There would be an instance of "
       "OSPFAreaConfiguration for each connected area of a "
       "router/OSPFService." )]
