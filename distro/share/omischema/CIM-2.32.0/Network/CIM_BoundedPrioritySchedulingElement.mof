    Description ( 
       "This class is a subclass of the class PriorityScheduling "
       "Element, which is itself derived from the abstract class "
       "SchedulingElement. As is the case with all subclasses of "
       "SchedulingElement, the input associated with an instance of "
       "BoundedPrioritySchedulingElement is of one of two types: "
       "either a queue, or another scheduler. BoundedPriority "
       "SchedulingElement adds an upper bound (BandwidthBound in "
       "kilobits per second) on how much traffic can be handled from "
       "an input. This data is specific to that one input. It is "
       "needed when bounded strict priority scheduling is performed. "
       "Note that this class inherits from its superclass the "
       "restriction of the inherited boolean property WorkConserving "
       "to TRUE." )]

          "A 32-bit unsigned integer that defines the upper limit "
          "on the amount of traffic that can be handled from the "
          "input (through this SchedulingElement). This is not a "
          "shaped upper bound, since bursts can occur. It is a "
          "strict bound, limiting the impact of the input. Units "
          "are kilobits per second." ),
