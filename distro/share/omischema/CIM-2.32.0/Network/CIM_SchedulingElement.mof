       "SchedulingElement represents the configuration information "
       "that a PacketSchedulingService has for one of the elements "

       "Among the subclasses of this class, some are defined in such a "
       "way that all of their instances are work conserving. Other "
       "subclasses, however, have instances that either are or are not "
       "work conserving. In this class, the boolean property "
       "WorkConserving indicates whether an instance is or is not work "
       "conserving. Note that WorkConserving is restricted to TRUE in "
       "the subclasses that are inherently work conserving, since "
       "instances of these classes cannot be anything else." )]

          "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, "
          "InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance "
          "of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the "
          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed "
          "using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "
          "\':\', and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, "
          "trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by "
          "the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or "
          "is a registered ID that is assigned to the business "
          "entity by a recognized global authority. (This is "
          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness "
          "<OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using "
          "this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID "
          "MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and SHOULD "
          "not be re-used to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \'preferred\' "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure "
          "that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this "
          "instance\'s NameSpace. \n"

          "ElementInSchedulingService aggregation) is treating the "
          "queue/input tied to this instance, in a work-conserving "
          "manner. The queue/input is indicated by either the "
          "QueueToSchedule or SchedulingServiceToSchedule "
          "association. Note that this property is writeable, "
          "indicating that an administrator can change the behavior "
