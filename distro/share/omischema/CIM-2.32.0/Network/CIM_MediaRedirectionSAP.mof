          "CIM_RemoteAccessAvailableToElement association to a "

          "a remote device, and the remote device does not respond "
          "before CommandTimeout times out, the Redirection Service "
          "will emulate a media eject event and re-try the command "
          "and/or try to re-establish the connection to the remote "
          "device. Commandtimeout shall be expressed using the "
          "interval format of the datetime type." )]

          "The amount of time the session shall wait after sending "
          "a Reset to the Remote System before concluding that the "
          "Remote System is not responding in a timely fashion, it "
          "may be hung or busy. When the Reset Timeout is exceeded "
          "the managed system tries to establish a new connection "
          "with the Remote System. ResetTimeout shall be expressed "
          "using the interval format of the datetime type." )]

          "The amount of time the session will wait for a Remote "
          "System to establish a new connection before the Media "
          "Device is detached. SessionTimeout shall be expressed "
