   [Deprecated { "CIM_DiffServService" }, 
    Version ( "2.7.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Network::QoS" ), 
    Description ( 
       "This class represents a specialization of the general concept "
       "of forwarding network traffic by adding specific semantics "
       "that characterize the operation of the Expedited Forwarding "
       "(EF) Service (defined in RFC 2598). \n"
       "\n"
       "The EF PHB can be used to build a low loss, low latency, low "
       "jitter, assured bandwidth, end-to-end service through DiffServ "
       "domains. Such a service appears to the endpoints like a "
       "point-to-point connection or a virtual leased line. This "
       "service has also been described as Premium service in the IETF "
       "literature. \n"
       "\n"
       "RFC 2598 defines one DSCP for the EF service. Thus, there is "
       "no need to define any attributes in this class, since an "
       "instance of the EFService class, by definition, means that "
       "this particular DSCP is used. \n"
       "\n"
       "EFService is deprecated since forwarding based on the value of "
       "the DiffServ Code Point is specified using a FilterList, which "
       "is associated with a ClassifierElement. If there is a need to "
       "distinguish a higher-level set of coordinated QoS services, "
       "the DiffServService class can be instantiated directly." )]
