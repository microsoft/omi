       "This aggregation represents the relationship between a "
       "ClassifierService and the ClassifierElements that provide its "
       "fan-out function. ClassifierElements represent the traffic "
       "selectors for the Service. A ClassifierService typically "
       "aggregates multiple ClassifierElements. An individual Element, "
       "however, is aggregated only by a single ClassifierService." )]

          "Because the filters for a classifier can overlap, it is "
          "necessary to specify the order in which the "
          "ClassifierElements are aggregated by a "
          "ClassifierService. This then dictates the order in which "
          "packets coming into the classifier are presented. Values "
          "are represented in ascending order: first \'1\', then "
          "\'2\', and so on. Different values MUST be assigned for "
          "each of the ClassifierElements aggregated by a given "
          "ClassifierService." )]
