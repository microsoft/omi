       "QueuingService represents the ability to queue network "
       "traffic, and to specify the characteristics for determining "
       "long-term congestion. It is modeled as a ConditioningService "
       "so that it can be aggregated into a QoSService (using the "
       "QoSConditioningSubService association). This indicates that "
       "its functionality underlies the QoSService." )]
