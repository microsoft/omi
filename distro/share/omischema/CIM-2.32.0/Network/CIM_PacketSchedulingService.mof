    Description ( 
       "This class represents the scheduling service, which is a "
       "process that determines whether a queued packet should be "
       "removed from a queue and sent to an output interface. Note "
       "that output interfaces can be physical network interfaces or "
       "interfaces to components internal to systems, such as "
       "crossbars or backplanes. In either case, if multiple queues "
       "are involved, schedulers are used to provide access to the "
       "interface. Each instance of a PacketSchedulingService "
       "describes a scheduler from the perspective of the queues that "
       "the scheduler is servicing. One can describe that different "
       "schedulers support different queues, or that a scheduler "
       "supports several queues. \n"
       "\n"
       "PacketSchedulingService is modeled as a ConditioningService so "
       "that it can be aggregated into a QoSService (using the "
       "QoSConditioningSubService association) to indicate that its "
       "functionality underlies that QoS service. It participates in "
       "the NextService association to identify a subsequent "
       "ConditioningService, if any, that acts on traffic after it has "
       "been processed by the scheduler." )]
