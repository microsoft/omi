    Description ( 
       "A FilterList aggregates instances of (subclasses of) "
       "FilterEntryBase via the aggregation EntriesInFilterList. The "
       "filter entries are always ANDed together when grouped by the "
       "FilterList. Note that it is possible to aggregate different "
       "types of filters into a single FilterList - for example, "
       "packet header filters (represented by the IpHeadersFilter "
       "class) and IPsec security filters. \n"
       "\n"
       "A FilterList is weak to the network device (e.g., the "
       "ComputerSystem) that contains it. Hence, the ComputerSystem "
       "keys are propagated to this class." )]

      [Key, Description ( 
          "CreationClassName indicates the name of the class or the "
          "subclass used in the creation of an instance. When used "
          "with the other key properties of this class, this "
          "property allows all instances of this class and its "
          "subclasses to be uniquely identified." ),

          "Entry is known and uniquely identified." ), 
       MaxLen ( 256 )]

      [Description ( 
          "Boolean indicating that the match condition described in "
          "the properties of the FilterEntryBase subclass should be "
          "negated. This property is defined for ease of use when "
          "filtering on simple negations - for example, to select "
          "all source ports except 162. It is not recommended that "
          "this Boolean be set to True when filtering on multiple "
          "criteria, such as defining an IPHeadersFilter based on "
          "source/destination addresses, ports, and DiffServ Code "
          "Points." )]
