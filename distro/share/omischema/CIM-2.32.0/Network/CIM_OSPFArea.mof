       "This class represents an OSPF area. The definition of an OSPF "
       "area from RFC2328, is \'OSPF allows sets of networks to be "
       "grouped together. Such a grouping is called an area. The "
       "topology of an area is hidden from the rest of the Autonomous "
       "System. This information hiding enables a significant "
       "reduction in routing traffic. Also, routing within the area is "
       "determined only by the area\'s own topology, lending the area "
       "protection from bad routing data.\' This class has a \'Type\' "
       "propery, which distinguishes between the different area types. "
       "This approach was chosen, because it provides a simpler way to "
       "indicate the type of an area, and additional subclassing is "
       "not needed at this time." )]
