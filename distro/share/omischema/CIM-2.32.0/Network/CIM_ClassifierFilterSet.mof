    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Network::QoS" ), 
    Description ( 
       "In order for a ClassifierService to correctly identify and "
       "process network traffic, that traffic must be described by "
       "FilterEntries, which are aggregated into FilterLists. This "
       "association defines the Dependency of the ClassifierService on "
       "FilterLists (and therefore, their FilterEntries). The "
       "cardinality of the association requires that the Classifier "
       "Service operate against at least one FilterList. \n"
       "\n"
       "The association is deprecated in lieu of associating Filter "
       "Lists to ClassifierElements, and ClassifierElements into "
       "ClassifierServices. The latter approach is very flexible "
       "regarding the implementations that can be modeled, and removes "
       "the need to track individual traffic streams using an "
       "artificial model property, TrafficClass. Using "
       "ClassifierElements, each stream is processed beginning with a "
       "single FilterList and progressing through various "
       "ConditioningServices, associated via instances of NextService." )]
