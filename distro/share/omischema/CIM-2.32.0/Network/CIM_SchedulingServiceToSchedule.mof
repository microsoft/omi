       "between a scheduler (PacketSchedulingService) and a "
       "SchedulingElement, in a configuration involving cascaded "
       "schedulers. The SchedulingElement, in turn, represents the "
       "information in a packet scheduling service that is specific to "
       "this scheduler, such as relative priority or allocated "

       "cardinalities, there is an additional constraint on "
       "participation in this association. A particular instance of (a "
       "subclass of) SchedulingElement always participates either in "
       "exactly one instance of this association, or in exactly one "
       "instance of the association QueueToSchedule." )]
