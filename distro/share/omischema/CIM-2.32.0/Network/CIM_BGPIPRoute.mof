    Description ( 
       "BGPIPRoute describes a BGP routing entry that connects two "
       "peer routers that are running BGP. The source and destination "
       "addresses may be either specific IP endpoints or IP subnets. "
       "Examining the BGPIPRoute class definition, note that its "
       "superclass IPRoute is deprecated. Unfortunately, IPRoute "
       "cannot be removed from the object hierarchy without a major "
       "Schema release. When/if this occurs, the IPRoute superclass "
       "will be removed, and BGPIPRoute will subclass from "
       "CIM_NextHopRouting directly." )]

          "Usually, the administrative distance is used to "
          "determine which route gets installed in the routing "
          "table. Using this scheme, routes learned via EBGP will "
          "win over routes learned via an IGP. If this is not "
          "desired, then this assigns the administrative distance "
          "of this route to be equal to that of a local route, "
          "which means that the same route learned by an IGP will "
          "have a lower administrative distance and be installed "
          "instead." )]

          "Loopback interfaces are often used by IBGP peers, "
          "because they eliminate a dependency that would otherwise "
          "occur if the actual IP address of a physical interface "
          "was used to configure BGP. The loopback interface "
          "instead instructs the router to use any available "
          "interface." )]
