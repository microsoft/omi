    Description ( 
       "This class represents the metering of network traffic. "
       "Metering is the function of monitoring the arrival times of "
       "packets of a traffic stream and determining the level of "
       "conformance of each packet with respect to a pre- established "
       "traffic profile. A meter has the ability to invoke different "
       "ConditioningServices for conforming and non-conforming "
       "traffic. Traffic leaving a meter may be further conditioned "
       "(e.g., dropped or queued) by routing the packet to another "
       "conditioning element. \n"
       "\n"
       "This class is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can "
       "be aggregated into a QoSService (using the "
       "QoSConditioningSubService association), to indicate that its "
       "functionality underlies that QoS service. MeterService also "
       "participates in a subclass of the NextService association, to "
       "identify the subsequent ConditioningServices for conforming "
       "and non-conforming traffic." )]
class CIM_MeterService : CIM_ConditioningService {

      [Description ( 
          "This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer "
          "that is used to specify the particular type of meter. "
          "Defined values of the enumeration are: \n"
          "\n"
          "1: Other \n"
          "2: Average Rate Meter \n"
          "3: Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Meter \n"
          "4: Token Bucket Meter \n"
          "\n"
          "Note: The MeterType property and the MeterService "
          "subclasses provide similar information. This property is "
          "defined for query purposes and for future expansion. It "
          "is assumed that not all MeterServices will require a "
          "subclass to define them. Therefore, MeterService will be "
          "instantiated directly and the Type property is needed." ),

          "level for this meter is defined in this property." ),

      [Description ( 
          "An unsigned integer indicating the number of conformance "
          "levels supported by the Meter. For example, when only "
          "\'in-profile\' or \'out of profile\' metering is "
          "supported. ConformanceLevels is set to 2." )]
