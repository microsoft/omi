    Description ( 
       "This association describes the relationship between a head or "
       "tail dropper and the queue that it monitors to determine when "
       "to drop traffic. The referenced queue\'s depth is compared "
       "against the Dropper\'s threshold property. Although the "
       "dropper drops from only one queue, the drop decision may be "
       "influenced by the state of several queues. The rule for "
       "combining the multiple inputs is simple addition: if the sum "
       "of the lengths of the monitored queues exceeds the dropper\'s "
       "QueueThreshold value, then packets are dropped. Note that this "
       "rule for combining inputs may be overridden." )]
