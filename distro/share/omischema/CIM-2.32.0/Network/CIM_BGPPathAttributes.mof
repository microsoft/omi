          "This property and its description are taken directly "

          "the tuple: \n"
          "<type, length, value> \n"

          "An AS_SET is an unordered set of ASs representing the "
          "path that an UPDATE message has traversed, and an "
          "AS_SEQUENCE is an ordered set of ASs representing the "
          "path that an UPDATE message has traversed. \n"
          "The length is a 1-octet field containing the number of "
          "ASs in the value field. \n"
          "The value field contains one or more AS numbers, each AS "
          "is represented in the octet string as a pair of octets "
