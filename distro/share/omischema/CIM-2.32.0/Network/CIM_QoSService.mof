    Description ( 
       "This is a concrete class that represents the ability to "
       "conceptualize a QoS service as a set of coordinated "
       "sub-services. This enables the network administrator to map "
       "business rules to the network, and the network designer to "
       "engineer the network such that it can provide different "
       "functions for different traffic streams. \n"
       "\n"
       "This class has two main purposes. First, it serves as a common "
       "base class for defining various sub-services that are needed "
       "to build higher-level QoS services. Second, it serves as a way "
       "to consolidate relationships between different types of QoS "
       "services and different types of ConditioningServices. \n"
       "\n"
       "For example, Gold Service may be defined as a QoSService which "
       "aggregates two other QoSServices together. Each of these "
       "\'other\' QoSServices could be DiffServServices - one "
       "representing the servicing of very high demand packets "
       "(instantiated as a DiffServService directly), and one "
       "representing the service given to most of the packets "
       "(instantiated as an AFService). The high demand "
       "DiffServService instance would use QoSConditioning SubService "
       "to aggregate together the necessary classifiers to indicate "
       "which traffic it applies to, the appropriate meters for "
       "contract limits, the marker to mark the EF PHB in the packets, "
       "and the queuing-related services. The AFService instance would "
       "similarly use QoSConditioning SubService to aggregate its "
       "classifiers, meters, the several markers used to mark the "
       "different AF PHBs in the packets, and the queuing-related "
       "services needed to deliver the packet treatment." )]
