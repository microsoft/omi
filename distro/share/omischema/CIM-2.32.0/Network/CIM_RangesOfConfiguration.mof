       "an instance of RangeOfIPAddresses MUST be associated to the "
       "router\'s OSPFAreaConfiguration, using this relationship. The "
       "association between the range and area configuration contains "
       "a property (EnableAdvertise) defining the handling - to allow "
       "or disallow advertismenets in the range." )]
