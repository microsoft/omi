    Description ( 
       "CIM_EndpointIdentity indicates that two ProtocolEndpoints "
       "represent different aspects of the same underlying address or "
       "protocol-specific ID. This association refines the "
       "CIM_LogicalIdentity superclass by restricting it to the "
       "Endpoint level and defining its use in well understood "
       "scenarios. One of these scenarios is to represent that an "
       "Endpoint has both \'LAN\' and protocol-specific aspects. For "
       "example, an Endpoint could be both a LANEndpoint as well as a "
       "DHCPEndpoint." )]
