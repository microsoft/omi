       "update policies. This enables an administrator to assign "
       "policies to the peer group, instead of individually. This "
       "enables the routers in the Peer Group to optimize UPDATE "
       "messages. Consequently, Peer Groups have a set of restrictions "
       "that must be followed in order to work correctly with external "
       "BGP peers. Otherwise, loss of routing information could occur. \n"
