    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Network::Routes" ), 
    Description ( 
       "NextHopRouting relates a destination address to the address or "
       "interface through which the remote address may be reached. An "
       "instance of this class can represent either static or dynamic "
       "routing, and may represent a routing table entry (but it is "
       "not required that all NextHopRoutes be in a routing table). "
       "Static routes are distinguished by setting the IsStatic "
       "boolean property to TRUE. Subclasses of NextHopRouting provide "
       "specific protocol and Key information. NextHopRoutes are "
       "dependent on at least one ForwardingService to execute them. "
       "This is conveyed by the CIM_NextHopForwardedByService "
       "association. \n"
       "\n"
       "NextHopRouting is deprecated in lieu of the more general, "
       "concrete NextHopRoute class. NextHopRoute allows the "
       "definition of BOTH a next hop address and an interface for "
       "transmission of the traffic. Also, it does not mandate the "
       "instantiation of a ForwardingService class. The latter is not "
       "needed if the sole purpose of the instance is to specify a "
       "\'desired/configured\' route. This is simply a specification "
       "of the next hop." )]
