       "The QoS Model describes the traffic conditioning functions in "
       "place for a network device. In order to \'be conditioned\', a "
       "packet is received at a ProtocolEndpoint. After "
       "\'conditioning\', a packet is dropped or leaves the device via "
       "a ProtocolEndpoint. This dependency on ProtocolEndpoints is "
       "defined by the ConditioningServiceOn Endpoint association. A "
       "property of the association, ServiceType, indicates whether "
       "the ConditioningService handles incoming (\"Ingress\") or "
       "out-going (\"Egress\") packets. This association is deprecated "
       "since different cardinalities are needed on the ingress and "
       "egress classes. This cannot be done using a single "
       "association." )]
