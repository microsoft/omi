    Description ( 
       "NetworkPipeComposition describes the makeup a pipe, based on "
       "lower-level ones. If the pipe is not composed of lower-level "
       "entities (i.e., its AggregationBehavior property is set to 2), "
       "then no instances of this association should be defined where "
       "the pipe has the role of GroupComponent. \n"
       "\n"
       "In the context of M.3100, this semantic is modeled as a Trail "
       "that is made up of one or more Connections. Both Trails and "
       "Connections are subclasses of M.3100\'s Pipe. Because of the "
       "flexibility of the NetworkPipeComposition association, there "
       "is no need to subclass NetworkPipe, as was done in M.3100, but "
       "merely to instantiate this association to describe the "
       "bundling of the lower-level pipes (connections), or the "
       "sequencing of them. How the lower-level pipes are aggregated "
       "is described by the property, AggregationBehavior, of "
       "NetworkPipe. If the pipes are combined in a sequence, the "
       "ordering is conveyed via the property, AggregationSequence, on "
       "this association." ),

          "the GroupComponent pipe is set to 0 or 3 (\"Unknown\" or "
          "\"Combined In Parallel\"), then this property MUST be "
          "set to 0. If the AggregationBehavior is set to 4 "
          "(\"Combined In Sequence\"), then this property SHOULD "
          "indicate the ordering of the component pipes. Ordering "
          "starts with 1 and larger numbers indicate subsequent "
          "pipes. The numbering does not have to be in sequence. "
          "The word SHOULD is used in this Description, since the "
          "specific ordering of all the component pipes may not be "
          "known. In these cases, a value of 0 would be placed in "
          "AggregationSequence to indicate that ordering "
          "information is not available." )]
