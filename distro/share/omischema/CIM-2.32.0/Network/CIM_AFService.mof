    Description ( 
       "This class represents a specialization to the general concept "
       "of forwarding network traffic by adding specific semantics "
       "that characterize the operation of the Assured Forwarding (AF) "
       "Service (RFC2597). This RFC defines four different AF classes "
       "to represent four different treatments of traffic (e.g., a "
       "different amount of forwarding resources, such as buffer space "
       "and bandwidth, are allocated). Within each AF class, IP "
       "packets are marked with one of three possible drop precedence "
       "values. The drop precedence of a packet determines the "
       "relative importance of that packet compared to other packets "
       "within the same AF class if congestion occurs. A congested "
       "interface will try to avoid dropping packets with a lower drop "
       "precedence value by instead discarding packets with a higher "
       "drop precedence value. \n"
       "\n"
       "Note that [R2597] defines 12 DSCPs that together represent the "
       "AF Per Hop Behavior (PHB) group. Implementations are free to "
       "extend this (e.g., add more classes and/or drop precedences). \n"
       "\n"
       "The AFService class is modeled as a specialization of "
       "DiffServService, which is in turn a specialization of "
       "QoSService. This enables it to be related to higher-level "
       "QoSServices, as well as to lower-level conditioning "
       "sub-services (e.g., classification, metering, dropping, "
       "queuing, and others)." )]

          "AFService (using QoSConditioningSubService), one SHOULD "
          "find markers with as many distinct values as is "
