    Description ( 
       "A class derived from FileSystem that represents access of the "
       "FileSystem via a network-related service. In this case, the "
       "file store is hosted by a computer, acting as a file server. "
       "For example, the file store for an NFS FileSystem is typically "
       "NOT on a ComputerSystem\'s locally controlled media, nor is it "
       "directly accessed through a device driver. Subclasses of "
       "RemoteFileSystem contain client-side configuration information "
       "related to the access of the FileSystem." )]
