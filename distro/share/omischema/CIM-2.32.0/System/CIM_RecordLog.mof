       "is achieved through the use of the standard CIM Operations "

          "of this class. \n"
          "In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the "
          "value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the "

          "the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or "
          "is a registered ID that is assigned to the business "
          "entity by a recognized global authority (This is similar "
          "to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema "
          "class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> "
          "MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using this "

          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure "
          "that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any "
