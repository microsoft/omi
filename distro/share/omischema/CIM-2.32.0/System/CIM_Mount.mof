    Description ( 
       "An association between a FileSystem and a Directory which "
       "indicates that the Directory is being attached to the "
       "FileSystem. The semantics of this relationship require that "
       "the mounted Directory be contained by a FileSystem (via the "
       "FileStorage association) that is different from the FileSystem "
       "referenced as the Dependent. The Directory\'s containing "
       "FileSystem could be either local or remote. For example, a "
       "LocalFileSystem on a Solaris ComputerSystem can mount a "
       "Directory from the FileSystem accessed via the machine\'s "
       "CDROM drive, i.e., another LocalFile System. On the other "
       "hand, in a \'remote\' case, the Directory is first exported by "
       "its FileSystem, which is hosted on another ComputerSystem "
       "acting (for example) as a file server. In order to distinguish "
       "these two types of Mount, it is recommended that a CIM_Export "
       "association always be defined for the remotely "
       "accessed/mounted Directories." )]
