    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::System::Logs" ), 
    Description ( 
       "DiagnosticsLog is being deprecated in order to change the "
       "class name to DiagnosticLog. This is being done to follow the "
       "naming convention used for other diagnostic model classes. \n"
       "DiagnosticsLog serves as an aggregation point for "
       "DiagnosticRecord objects. This class exists in order to "
       "encourage the use of a consolidated record management "
       "methodology for diagnostics. A common set of providers for "
       "this log and its associated records SHOULD be used to control "
       "functions such as record persistence, query support and "
       "overall data integrity in a consistent manner." )]
