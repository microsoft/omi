    Description ( 
       "A class derived from FileSystem that represents the file store "
       "controlled by a ComputerSystem through local means (e.g., "
       "direct device driver access). In this case, the file store is "
       "managed directly by the ComputerSystem without the need for "
       "another computer to act as a file server. This definition does "
       "not breakdown in the case of a Clustered File System. In this "
       "scenario, the FileSystem is a LocalFileSystem, weak to the "
       "Cluster." )]
