    Description ( 
       "A class derived from SettingData that provides the information "
       "necessary to describe a boot source. This may be optionally "
       "associated to a bootable logical device, such as a hard disk "
       "partition, or a network device. The information from this "
       "class instance is used by the boot manager, such as BIOS/EFI "
       "or OS Loader to initiate the boot process, when this instance "
       "appears in a BootConfigSetting collection." )]

          "used by the instrumentation to pass to the boot manager "
          "as a selection string. This could be a string "
          "identifying the bootable device, such as \"CDROM 1\", or "
          "could be an implementation specific address of a "
          "bootable partition, such as the following. \"fd(64)unix "

          "to the string used by the BIOS to uniquely name the boot "
          "source. For example, in systems which implement the BIOS "
          "Boot Specification, the string could correspond to the "

          "<OrgID>, <identifier> or <index> contains a colon (\":\"). "

          "otherwise unique name that is owned by the entity "
          "defining the <identifier>, or is a registered ID that is "
          "assigned to the entity by a recognized global authority. "
          "For DMTF defined identifiers, the <OrgID> is set to "
          "\'CIM\'. The <identifiers> are \"Floppy\", \"Hard-Disk\", "

          "A value of 1 (Is Supported) indicates that next boot "
          "source the boot order is used. A value of 2 (Is Not "
          "Supported) indicates that the boot order is terminated "
