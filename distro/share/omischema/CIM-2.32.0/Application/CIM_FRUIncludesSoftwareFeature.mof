    Description ( 
       "The FRUIncludesSoftwareFeature association identifies the "
       "SoftwareFeature(s) packaged with a particular FRU. A common "
       "usage is to determine whether the FRU is compatible with a "
       "hardware/software platform. In order to determine this, the "
       "following conditions need to be verified: \n"
       "(1) Is the physical package of the FRU compatible with the "
       "slots or equivalent packaging of the hardware? \n"
       "(2) Are there any physical constraints (such as power "
       "consumption) that prevent the FRU from being installed? \n"
       "(3) Are the SoftwareFeatures packaged with the FRU compatiable "
       "with the underlying operating system and other software "
       "already installed/to be installed on the platform? \n"
       "This latter question can be answered by first checking if an "
       "instance of FRUIncludesSoftwareFeature exists. If it does, "
       "then the compatibility of each SoftwareFeature can be "
       "determined by evaluating the Check classes for the Software "
       "Elements that are part of the Feature (found by traversing the "
       "association, SoftwareFeatureSoftwareElements). For example, "
       "there might be a SoftwareElementVersionCheck that declares "
       "that a SoftwareElement (of the FRU\'s Software Feature) is not "
       "compatible with current software." )]
