    Description ( 
       "The CIM_SoftwareFeature class defines a particular function or "
       "capability of a product or application system. This class "
       "captures a level of granularity describing a unit of "
       "installation, rather than the units that reflect how the "
       "product is built or packaged. The latter detail is captured "
       "using a CIM_SoftwareElement class. When a SoftwareFeature can "
       "exist on multiple platforms or operating systems (for example, "
       "a client component of a three tiered client/server application "
       "that runs on Solaris, Windows NT, and Windows 95), the Feature "
       "is a collection of all the SoftwareElements for these "
       "different platforms. In this case, the users of the model must "
       "be aware of this situation since typically they will be "
       "interested in a sub-collection of the SoftwareElements "
       "required for a particular platform. \n"
       "SoftwareFeatures are always defined in the context of a "
       "CIM_Product, using the CIM_ProductSoftwareFeature association. "
       "Features are delivered through Products. Optionally, "
       "SoftwareFeatures from one or more Products can be organized "
       "into ApplicationSystems using the "
       "CIM_ApplicationSystemSoftwareFeature association." )]
