   [Association, Version ( "2.6.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Application::DeploymentModel" ), 
    Description ( 
       "An association between a ServiceAccessPoint and how it is "
       "implemented by one or more executable SoftwareElements. Note "
       "that this association is restricted to \'executable\' "
       "Elements. In earlier phases of deployment, the Software "
       "FeatureSAPImplementation association is adequate and "
       "recommended. \n"
       "The relationship between this association and Software "
       "FeatureSAPImplementation is more fully described here. "
       "SoftwareElementSAPImplementation allows the description of "
       "greater granularity than SoftwareFeatureSAPImplementation, "
       "when a SoftwareFeature is fully deployed and results in "
       "several executable Elements. These Elements may implement "
       "several different ServiceAccessPoints. \n"
       "Since SoftwareFeatures decompose into SoftwareElements, it is "
       "possible to describe how software implements a SAP by using "
       "either this association or the SoftwareFeatureSAP "
       "Implementation relationship. One or the other should be "
       "chosen. Both associations should not be used for a particular "
       "AccessPoint, since their information is redundant. \n"
       "This relationship is especially important when the "
       "SoftwareFeature and Product aspects are not described for a "
       "SoftwareElement (ie, when the acquisition and deployment of "
       "the software is not detailed). In this case, the Software "
       "ElementSAPImplementation association is the only one available "
       "to describe how an AccessPoint is implemented in software. "
       "Since SoftwareFeatures are not instantiated, it is not "
       "possible to use the SoftwareFeatureSAP Implementation "
       "association. \n"
       "The cardinality of this association is many-to-many. A "
       "ServiceAccessPoint may be provided by more than one Software "
       "Element. (If this is true, it is assumed that the Software "
       "Elements operate in conjunction.) And, any SoftwareElement may "
       "provide more than one SAP." )]
