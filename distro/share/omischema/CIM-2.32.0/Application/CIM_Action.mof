       "A CIM_Action is an operation that is part of a process to "
       "either create a SoftwareElement in its next state or to "
       "eliminate the SoftwareElement in its current state. A "
       "CIM_ComputerSystem object represents the environment in which "
       "CIM_SoftwareElements are already deployed/installed or into "
       "which the elements will be deployed/installed. For the case in "
       "which an element is already installed, the "
       "CIM_InstalledSoftwareElement association identifies the "
       "CIM_ComputerSystem object that represents the \"environment\". "
       "When a SoftwareElement is being deployed for installation on a "
       "ComputerSystem, that system is the target of the Action and is "
       "identified using the TargetSystem reference of the "
       "InvokeOnSystem method." )]
