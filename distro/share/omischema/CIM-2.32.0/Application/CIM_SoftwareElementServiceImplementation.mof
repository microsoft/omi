   [Association, Version ( "2.6.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Application::DeploymentModel" ), 
    Description ( 
       "An association between a Service and how it is implemented by "
       "one or more executable SoftwareElements. Note that this "
       "association is restricted to \'executable\' Elements. In "
       "earlier phases of deployment, the SoftwareFeatureService "
       "Implementation association is adequate and recommended. \n"
       "The relationship between this association and Software "
       "FeatureServiceImplementation is more fully described here. "
       "SoftwareElementServiceImplementation allows the description of "
       "greater granularity than SoftwareFeatureService "
       "Implementation, when a SoftwareFeature is fully deployed and "
       "results in several executable Elements. These Elements may "
       "implement several different Services. \n"
       "Since SoftwareFeatures decompose into SoftwareElements, it is "
       "possible to describe how software implements a Service by "
       "using either this association or the SoftwareFeature "
       "ServiceImplementation relationship. One or the other should be "
       "chosen. Both associations should not be used for a single "
       "Service instance, since their information is redundant. \n"
       "This relationship is especially important when the "
       "SoftwareFeature and Product aspects are not described for a "
       "SoftwareElement (ie, when the acquisition and deployment of "
       "the software is not detailed). In this case, the Software "
       "ElementServiceImplementation association is the only one "
       "available to describe how a Service is implemented in "
       "software. Since SoftwareFeatures are not instantiated, it is "
       "not possible to use the SoftwareFeatureService Implementation "
       "association. \n"
       "The cardinality of this association is many-to-many. A Service "
       "may be provided by more than one SoftwareElement. If this is "
       "true, it is assumed that the SoftwareElements operate in "
       "conjunction. And, any SoftwareElement may provide more than "
       "one Service." )]
