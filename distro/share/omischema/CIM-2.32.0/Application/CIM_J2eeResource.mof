       "The J2eeResource class is a base class for all managed object "

       "resources that are utilized by the J2EE server to provide the "
       "J2EE standard services required by the J2EE platform "
       "architecture. The J2EEResource class has several subclasses "
       "that do not add any new properties. The option of using a type "
       "property to identify the different resource types while doing "
       "away with the numerous empty subclasses was not chosen because "
       "the subclasses, when enhanced by vendor specific extensions "
