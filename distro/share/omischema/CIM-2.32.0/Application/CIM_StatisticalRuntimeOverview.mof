       "This class represents statistical data and metrics that "
       "characterize the application as a whole. It exists only once "
       "per application system instance and provides primarily raw "
       "data for the monitoring of service levels. Therefore, the "
       "metrics presented are only a summary or overview of the "
       "application system behavior at a certain point of time. "
       "Instances are only available if the concerned application is "
       "running. Therefore, an instance of ApplicationSystem MUST "

          "The average response time is the mean of a number of "
          "requests captured between StatisticTime and a close "
          "point in time in the past. This interval or duration, "
          "that the average depends on, is defined by the "
          "underlying implementation such that it still has a "
          "reasonable proximity to one point in time. The term "
          "average is not focused on averaging a number of requests "
          "but averaging a period of time. Therefore, the average "
          "does not relate to more than a couple of minutes and, "
          "consequently, AverageResponseTime has the notion of the "
          "response time at the point in time of StatisticTime. If "
          "the interval is too great, AverageResponseTime becomes "
          "meaningless for monitoring. If no response time can be "
          "determined, the value is 0." ),
