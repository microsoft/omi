    Description ( 
       "The J2eeStatistic class is a base class that defines the "
       "properties that are common to all J2EE statistics. The JSR77 "
       "specification defines a set of statistical types, then it "
       "defines each J2EE statistic in terms of these types. Since CIM "
       "does not support multiple inheritance or embedded objects, the "
       "count, time, range, bounded range, and boundary statistics "
       "defined have been broken out into individual properties for "
       "each statistic that is defined in the JSR77 specification. \n"
       "Many of the properties defined for J2EE statistics are "
       "inherited from the CIM_StatisticalData class. Some of the "
       "inherited properties are CIM dates, which are not consistent "
       "with the definitions in the JSR77 specification. In order to "
       "minimize implementation differences, methods are defined to "
       "provide the dates as specified. Some of the subclasses of "
       "CIM_J2EEStatistic do not add any new properties. However, "
       "these subclasses were chosen over adding a type property to "
       "the superclass because the vendor extensions were likely to "
       "result in classes with characteristics distinct enough to "
       "warrant the existence of subclasses." )]

          "a long, whose value is the number of milliseconds since "
          "January 1, 1970,00:00:00. This method converts the "
          "StartStatisticTime property to the format defined in the "
          "JSR77 specification. The related property "
          "CIM_StatisticalData.StartStatisticTime represents the "
          "same information as a CIMDatetime entity." ),
