       "Within an automated StorageLibrary, Media should be accessible "
       "to the various robotics and MediaTransferDevices (Pickers, "
       "Changers, InterLibraryPorts, etc.). The Library may be "
       "serviced by different TransferDevices, each responsible for a "
       "subset of the Library\'s StorageMediaLocations. The Device "
       "ServicesLocation association indicates that the Transfer "
       "Device handles Media stored in the referenced Location. For "
       "example, LibraryPort \'A\' may only service Media from Slots "
       "1-10, while LibraryPort \'B\' covers Slots 11-33. This detail "
       "is conveyed by this association." )]
