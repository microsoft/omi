       "LogicalDisks can be BasedOn a DiskPartition. For example, a "
       "personal computer\'s C: drive may be located on a Partition on "
       "local PhysicalMedia. In this association of LogicalDisks to "
       "Partitions, note that the cardinality of the Antecedent, Disk "
       "Partition, is Max (1). This dictates that a LogicalDisk can "
       "not span more than one Partition. However, there are cases "
       "where this is true. When it occurs, the LogicalDisk is really "
       "based on some kind of RAID configuration (for example, a "
       "mirror or stripe set). In these scenarios, the LogicalDisk is "
       "more correctly BasedOn a StorageVolume. To prevent incorrectly "
       "using the LogicalDiskBasedOnPartition association, the Max (1) "
       "qualifier was put on the Antecedent reference to the "
       "DiskPartition." )]
