    Description ( 
       "CIM_WiFiRadio describes a radio transceiver component of a "
       "WiFiPort. It is modeled because of the possibility of multiple "
       "transceivers being associated with a single port, the "
       "possibility of multiple ports being associated with a single "
       "radio transceiver, and the possibility of enabling/disabling a "
       "radio transceiver independent of its associated WiFiPort." )]
