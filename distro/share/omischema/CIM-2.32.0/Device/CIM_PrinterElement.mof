    Description ( 
       "This class extends LogicalElement to abstract the concept of a "
       "PrinterElement that is a component (e.g., PrintMarker) of a "
       "scoping Printer (print device). This class defines common "
       "properties for key (InstanceID) and for correlation of status "
       "and event (alert) information between CIM and SNMP management "
       "interfaces (SNMPRowId). \n"
       "Note: A Printer shall be associated with at least one of every "
       "required component (e.g., PrintMarker) via an instance of the "
       "PrinterComponent class. A Printer may be associated with zero "
       "or more optional components (e.g., PrintSupply) via an "
       "instance of the ConcreteComponent class. See: Model in section "
       "2 of Printer MIB (RFC 3805) and section 3 of Finisher MIB (RFC "
       "3806)." )]

       Description ( 
          "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, "
          "InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance "
          "of this class. To ensure uniqueness within the "
          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed "
          "using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "
          "(:), and where <OrgID> shall include a copyrighted, "
          "trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by "
          "the business entity that is creating or defining the "
          "InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the "
          "business entity by a recognized global authority. (This "
          "requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> "
          "structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure "
          "uniqueness, <OrgID> shall not contain a colon (:). When "
          "using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in "
          "InstanceID shall appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should "
          "not be reused to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \"preferred\" "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity shall assure "
          "that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the "
          "NameSpace of this instance. \n"
