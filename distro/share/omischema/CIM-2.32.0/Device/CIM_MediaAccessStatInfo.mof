          "Method to reset the statistical counters. The method "

          "seek-related counters. The method returns 0 if "
          "successful, 1 if not supported, and any other value if "
          "an error occurred. A method is specified so that the "
          "Device\'s instrumentation can also reset its internal "
          "processing and counters. \n"
