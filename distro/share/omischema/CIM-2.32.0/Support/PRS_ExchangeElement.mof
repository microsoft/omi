    Description ( 
       "PRS_ExchangeElement is an abstract base class for all classes "
       "in the Solution and Service Incident object model. As an "
       "abstract class it is never instantiated. \n"
       "\n"
       "PRS_ExchangeElement exists to provide a single anchor point "
       "for associations that may be made to any Solution or Service "
       "Incident object. For example, Administrative or Attachment "
       "instances may be associated with any object derived from "
       "PRS_ExchangeElement. To support this generic association "
       "capability, the PRS_AdminAssociation and PRS_Attached "
       "associations both derive from the CIM_Dependency association "
       "and override the Antecedent property of that class to be a "
       "PRS_ExchangeElement REF." )]

          "The PRSUniqueName property is a Globally Unique "
          "IDentifier (GUID) also known as a Universally Unique "
          "IDentifier (UUID). This property allows Solution and "
          "Service Incident objects to be used by multiple "
          "Solutions or Service Incidents without duplication. In "
          "addition, all Solution or Service Incidents containing a "
          "unique object are updated when the object is updated." )]

          "It is the responsibility of the entity creating, "
