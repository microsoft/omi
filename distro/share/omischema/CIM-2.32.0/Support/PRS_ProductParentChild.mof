    Description ( 
       "Products may exist in a hierarchy of relationships with "
       "related Products. If a Producer deems these hierarchy "
       "relationships are relevant to the current Problem or "
       "Resolution, then the position of the Product in a hierarchy "
       "can be implied using one of two types of relationships: \'is "
       "a\' and \'has a\'. An \'is a\' relationship implies a "
       "classification, such as versioning or typing. A \'has a\' "
       "relationship implies that one product contains another. The "
       "PRS_ProductParentChild association is used to imply an \'is a\' "
       "hierarchy. Use the ProductComponent association to imply \'has "
       "a\' relationships." )]
