       "PRS_Attachment describes file attachments. A PRS_Attachment "
       "may be associated to any object derived from "

       "embedded data. A \'by reference\' approach links indirectly to "
       "the attachment through the use of a string identifier, e.g. a "
       "file name. An \'embedded data\' approach means the actual "
       "binary data is included in PRS_Attachment." )]
