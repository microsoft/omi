    Description ( 
       "PRS_Solution is the root class of a set of associated classes "
       "used to describe a single Solution. If a Solution is "
       "associated with multiple Problems or Resolutions, all of the "
       "Problems described are related to all of the Resolutions "
       "described. The reverse is also true. All of the Resolutions "
       "described are related to all of the Problems described in the "
       "Solution. \n"
       "\n"
       "PRS_Solution is directly associated to one or more of the "
       "following classes: \n"

          "non-diagnostic technical or general information using "
          "PRS_Statement objects. A \'Diagnostic\' Solution "
          "includes one or more PRS_Problem and PRS_Resolution "
          "objects. A \'How To\' Solution describes how to solve a "
