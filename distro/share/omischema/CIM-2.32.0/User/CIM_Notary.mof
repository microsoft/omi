       "CIM_Notary is an AuthenticationService which compares the "
       "biometric characteristics of a person with known "
       "characteristics, to establish identity. An example is a bank "
       "teller who compares a picture ID with the person trying to "
       "cash a check, or a biometric login service that uses voice "
       "recognition to identify a \'user\'." )]

          "includes tamper-resistent coatings and markings to "
          "protect the recorded decision that a driver, having "
          "various biometric characteristics of height, weight, "
