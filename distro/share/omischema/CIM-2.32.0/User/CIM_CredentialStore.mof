          "of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the "
          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed "
          "using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "

          "entity by a recognized global authority. (This is "
          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, "
          "<OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using "
          "this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID "
          "MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the organizational entity and "
          "SHOULD not be re-used to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \'preferred\' "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure "
          "that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this "
          "instance\'s NameSpace. \n"
