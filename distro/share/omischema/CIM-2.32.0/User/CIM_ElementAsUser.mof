    Description ( 
       "CIM_ElementAsUser is an association used to establish the "
       "\'ownership\' of UsersAccess object instances. That is, the "
       "ManagedElement may have UsersAccess to systems and, therefore, "
       "be \'users\' on those systems. UsersAccess instances must have "
       "an \'owning\' ManagedElement. Typically, the ManagedElements "
       "will be limited to Collection, Person, Service and "
       "ServiceAccessPoint. Other non-human ManagedElements that might "
       "be thought of as having UsersAccess (e.g., a device or system) "
       "have services that have the UsersAccess. \n"
       "\n"
       "Since the UsersAccess class is deprecated in lieu of "
       "CIM_Identity, this association is also deprecated and replaced "
       "by one of similar semantics, AssignedIdentity. It should be "
       "noted that the new class is NOT defined as a Dependency "
       "relationship, since it was felt that the association was not "
       "truly a dependency of the element on its access." )]
