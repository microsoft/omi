    Description ( 
       "This association defines the sub-UnitsOfWork (the sub- "
       "transactions) for a particular UnitOfWorkDefinition. For "
       "example, an \'AddOrder\' UnitOfWork could have sub-Units of "
       "\'ValidateCustomer\', \'ValidatePartNumber\', "
       "\'UpdateDatabase\', etc. This is a Dependency relationship "
       "since the sub-UnitsOf Work are put in context relative to the "
       "parent Unit. It is not an aggregation relationship - since "
       "(using another example) a \'DatabaseWrite\' transaction is "
       "likely to be dependent upon a \'DiskWrite\', but the two "
       "transactions are separate concepts and one is not \'contained\' "
       "by the other." )]
