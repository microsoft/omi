    Description ( 
       "A class derived from StorageExtent that describes opaque "
       "management data in managed systems. The structure and "
       "semantics of opaque management data, which may be standardized "
       "or proprietary, are assumed to be known by at least one "
       "management client, but need not be known by the CIM server. "
       "The UntransformedDataFormat property identifies the structure "
       "and semantics of the data.\n"
       "Opaque management data are typically stored in non-volatile "
       "memory that is accessible to the server. Management clients "
       "are able to read and write opaque data, to manage their "
       "lifetime, and to configure the access rights associated with "
       "them. The non-volatile storage is often used as a mailbox, "
       "with local management agents producing data for consumption by "
       "remote management clients, or vice versa.\n"
       "This class is not intended as a general-purpose opaque "
       "alternative to any existing or planned CIM classes. It is "
       "expressly intended for the mailbox usage model described "
       "above." )]

          "The date and time when the opaque management data was "
          "last accessed. Any operation on the OpaqueManagementData "
          "instance constitutes access. This property shall be NULL "
