    Description ( 
       "A class derived from RedundancySet describing storage-related "
       "redundancy information. StorageRedundancySets are used to "
       "protect user data. They aggregate one or more underlying "
       "StorageExtents, associated via MemberOfCollection, and produce "
       "one or more higher-level Extents. The Extents are related to "
       "each other via a BasedOn association. And, the higher level "
       "Extent is related to the StorageRedundancy Set via the "
       "LogicalIdentity association. \n"
       "Note that StorageRedundancySets may overlap in their "
       "aggregation of members. If this occurs, the overlapping "
       "Extents SHOULD NOT contain any check data." )]
