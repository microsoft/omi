    Description ( 
       "Note: The use of CIM_Configuration is deprecated in favor of "
       "aggregating instances of Setting or SettingData into "
       "\"higher-level\" Settings or SettingData objects using the "
       "ConcreteComponent association. This association simplifies the "
       "use of Settings or SettingData. With Configurations serving as "
       "aggregations of Settings (as defined by the Configuration "
       "Component relationship), separate associations were needed for "
       "the aggregation and to tie an element to either its "
       "Configurations or Settings or SettingData. These separate "
       "associations introduced unnecessary complexity and redundancy "
       "into the model. \n"
       "Deprecated description: The Configuration object allows the "
       "grouping of sets of parameters (defined in Setting objects) "
       "and dependencies for one or more ManagedSystemElements. It "
       "represents a certain behavior or a desired functional state "
       "for the ManagedSystemElements. The desired functional state of "
       "the Configuration is typically driven by external requirements "
       "such as time or location. For example, to connect to a Mail "
       "System from home, a dependency on a modem exists, but a "
       "dependency on a network adapter exists at work. Settings for "
       "the pertinent LogicalDevices (in this example, POTSModem and "
       "NetworkAdapter) can be defined and aggregated by the "
       "Configuration. Therefore, two \"Connect to Mail\" "
       "Configurations can be defined by grouping the relevant "
       "dependencies and Setting objects." )]
