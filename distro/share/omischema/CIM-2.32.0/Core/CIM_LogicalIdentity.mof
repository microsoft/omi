   [Association, Abstract, Version ( "2.10.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Core::CoreElements" ), 
    Description ( 
       "CIM_LogicalIdentity is an abstract and generic association, "
       "indicating that two ManagedElements represent different "
       "aspects of the same underlying entity. This relationship "
       "conveys what could be defined with multiple inheritance. In "
       "most scenarios, the Identity relationship is determined by the "
       "equivalence of Keys or some other identifying properties of "
       "the related Elements. \n"
       "\n"
       "This relationship is reasonable in several scenarios. For "
       "example, it could be used to represent that a LogicalDevice is "
       "both a \'bus\' entity and a \'functional\' entity. A Device "
       "could be both a USB (bus) and a Keyboard (functional) entity." )]
class CIM_LogicalIdentity {

      [Key, Description ( 
          "SystemElement represents one aspect of the Managed "
          "Element. The use of \'System\' in the role name does not "
          "limit the scope of the association. The role name was "
          "defined in the original association, where the "
          "referenced elements were limited to LogicalElements. "
          "Since that time, it has been found valuable to "
          "instantiate these types of relationships for "
          "ManagedElements, such as Collections. So, the referenced "
          "elements of the association were redefined to be "
          "ManagedElements. Unfortunately, the role name could not "
          "be changed without deprecating the entire association. "
          "This was not deemed necessary just to correct the role "
          "name." )]

          "SameElement represents an alternate aspect of the ManagedElement."
