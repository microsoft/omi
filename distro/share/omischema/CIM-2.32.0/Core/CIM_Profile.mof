   [Deprecated { "CIM_SettingData", "CIM_Setting",

    Version ( "2.19.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Core::Settings" ), 
    Description ( 
       "Note: The use of CIM_Profile is deprecated in favor of "
       "aggregating instances of Setting or SettingData into "
       "\"higher-level\" Settings or SettingData objects using the "
       "ConcreteComponent association. This use simplifies the use of "
       "Settings or SettingData. With Profiles subclassing from "
       "Collection, separate associations were needed between an "
       "element and either its Profiles or Settings or SettingData. "
       "This class introduced unnecessary complexity and redundancy "
       "into the model. \n"
       "Deprecated description: Profile specifies a general collection "
       "of Settings or SettingData objects that are logically grouped "
       "together. Note: The CIM_Profile class uses simplified naming "
       "or identity algorithms and collection algorithms, as compared "
       "to CIM_Configuration. The settings are \"collected\" into the "
       "Profile using the MemberOfCollection association. Note that a "
       "Profile obtains its setting data and other necessary "
       "information from collected Setting and SettingData instances "
       "and by the definition of additional properties in subclasses. "
       "One example of a Profile is to define the collection of "
       "settings for a particular person. Another is to define the "
       "collection of settings that are appropriate when initializing "
       "a system. \n"
       "Profile is tied to a ManagedElement using the ElementProfile "
       "association. The ManagedElement provides the context for the "
       "Profile, and the settings collected by Profile should be "
       "settings of the associated ManagedElement. Note that a "
       "ManagedElement cannot exist when the Profile is instantiated. "
       "This situation is important to remember when the Profile is "
       "used in the creation of the real-world entity that is "
       "represented by (and then instantiated in) the ManagedElement." )]

          "description: Within the scope of the instantiating "
          "Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies "
          "an instance of this class. To ensure uniqueness within "
          "the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be "
          "constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "
          "(:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, "
          "trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by "
          "the business entity that is creating or defining the "
          "InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the "
          "business entity by a recognized global authority. (This "
          "requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> "
          "structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure "
          "uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When "
          "using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in "
          "InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should "
          "not be reused to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \"preferred\" "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure "
          "that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any "
          "InstanceIDs that are produced by this or other providers "
          "for the NameSpace of this instance. \n"
          "For DMTF-defined instances, the preferred algorithm must "
          "be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM." )]
