    Description ( 
       "Note: The Configuration class is being deprecated in lieu of "
       "using a ConcreteComponent relationship to indicate a hierarchy "
       "of Setting or SettingData instances. Therefore, this "
       "association is also deprecated but it is deprecated to \"No "
       "value\" because there are no equivalent relationships "
       "currently defined for the Setting or SettingData classes. This "
       "association is an anomaly because it defines what cannot be "
       "expressed for the components of the Configuration. Also, it "
       "singles out the Dependency association as opposed to allowing "
       "any relationships to be defined as \"settings\". Its use in "
       "the industry is discouraged. \n"
       "Deprecated description: This relationship associates a "
       "Dependency with one or more Configuration objects. For "
       "example, dependencies for a ComputerSystem could change based "
       "on the site or network to which the System is attached." )]
