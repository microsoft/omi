       "ManagedElements and applicable setting data. This association "

      [Description ( 
          "An enumerated integer indicating that the referenced "
          "setting is a default setting for the element, or that "
          "this information is unknown." ),

      [Description ( 
          "An enumerated integer indicating that the referenced "
          "setting is currently being used in the operation of the "
          "element, or that this information is unknown." ),

      [Description ( 
          "An enumerated integer indicating whether or not the "
          "referenced setting is the next setting to be applied. "
          "For example, the application could take place on a "
          "re-initialization, reset, reconfiguration request. This "
          "could be a permanent setting, or a setting used only one "
          "time, as indicated by the flag. If it is a permanent "
          "setting then the setting is applied every time the "
          "managed element reinitializes, until this flag is "
          "manually reset. However, if it is single use, then the "
          "flag is automatically cleared after the settings are "
          "applied. Also note that if this flag is specified (i.e. "
          "set to value other than \"Unknown\"), then this takes "
          "precedence over any SettingData that may have been "
          "specified as Default. For example: If the managed "
          "element is a computer system, and the value of this flag "
          "is \"Is Next\", then the setting will be effective next "
          "time the system resets. And, unless this flag is "
          "changed, it will persist for subsequent system resets. "
          "However, if this flag is set to \"Is Next For Single "
          "Use\", then this setting will only be used once and the "
          "flag would be reset after that to \"Is Not Next\". So, "
          "in the above example, if the system reboots in a quick "
          "succession, the setting will not be used at the second "
          "reboot." ), 
       ValueMap { "0", "1", "2", "3" }, 
       Values { "Unknown", "Is Next", "Is Not Next", 
          "Is Next For Single Use" }]
   uint16 IsNext;
