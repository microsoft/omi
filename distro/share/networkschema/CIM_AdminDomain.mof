       "grouping is viewed as a single entity, reflecting that all of "
       "its components are administered similarly, either by the same "
       "user, group of users, or policy. It serves as an aggregation "
       "point to associate one or more of the following elements: "
       "network devices, such as routers and switches, servers, and "
       "other resources that can be accessed by end systems. This "
       "grouping of devices plays an essential role in ensuring that "
       "the same administrative policy and actions are applied to all "
       "of the devices in the grouping. The specific behavior and/or "
       "semantics of the AdminDomain can be identified through its "
       "aggregated and associated entities." )]
