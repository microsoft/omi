          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed "
          "using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"

          "entity by a recognized global authority. (This is "
          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness "
          "<OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using "
          "this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID "
          "MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and SHOULD "
          "not be re-used to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If the above \'preferred\' "
          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure "
          "that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this "
          "instance\'s NameSpace. For DMTF defined instances, the "
