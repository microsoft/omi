          "using the following \'preferred\' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"

          "entity by a recognized global authority. (This is "
          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness "

          "algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure "
          "that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any "
          "InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this "
