This is omi.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from omi.texi.

1 Introduction
**************

This manual explains how to get started with OMI. It is by no means a
complete reference, but hopefully after reading it you will be able to:

   * Build from the source distribution.
   * Install the distribution.
   * Start and stop the server.
   * Use the command-line client.
   * Develop and test a simple provider.
   * Develop a simple client application.

1.1 What is OMI?
================

OMI is a software service that runs on managed nodes.  It provides the
manageability infrastructure for building distributed systems management
applications based on DMTF management standards, including:

   * CIM Infrastructure Specification (DSP0004).
   * CIM Schema (<http://dmtf.org/standards/cim>).
   * Generic Operations Specification (DSP0223).
   * WS-Management Protocol (DSP0226, DSP0227, DSP0230; see also ISO/IEC
     17963:2013).

These standards define:

   * A meta-model that defines rules for forming classes, properties,
     methods, and instances.
   * A schema that defines specific classes for various management
     domains (_e.g._  storage, networking, operating systems).  The
     schema is expressed using the "Managed Object Format" (DSP0004).
   * The operations that CIM clients may perform on CIM servers.
   * The protocols enabling clients and servers to communicate (_e.g._
     WS-Management, CIM-XML).

A software service that implements these standards is a CIM Server, also
known as a CIM Object Manager (CIMOM). For more information on these
standards, visit the DMTF (Desktop Management Task Force) web site:
<http://dmtf.org>.

Note: WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise Management) comprises several
standards, including CIM (Common Information Model) and WS-Management
(which is now specified in ISO/IEC 17963:2013).  WBEM refers to the
broader set of standards.  For this reason, the server is named OMI.

1.2 What does a CIM Server do?
==============================

In general, a CIM server enables client applications to perform
operations on managed resources, such as CPUs, disks, networks, and
processes.  Typical operations include:

   * Enumerating resource instances.
   * Invoking a method on a resource.
   * Subscribing to events on a resources.

But CIM servers do not perform these operations on resources directly.
Instead servers furnish developers with a framework for building
pluggable modules called providers.  Providers are modules that interact
directly with one or more resources.  For example, a "process provider"
interacts with operating system processes.  Providers are packaged as
shared libraries with a main entry point (used by the server to
initialize the provider).

1.3 Operations
==============

OMI enables clients to perform the following CIM/WBEM operations on
providers:

   * GetInstance - gets a single instance from the server.
   * EnumerateInstances - enumerates instances of a given CIM class.
   * CreateInstance - creates an instance of a CIM class.
   * DeleteInstance - deletes an instance.
   * ModifyInstance - modifies the properties of an instance.
   * Associators - finds instances associated with a given instance.
   * References - finds references that refer to a given instance.
   * Invoke - invokes a method on a given instance or class.
   * Subscribe - subscribes to an Indication class or group of classes.

OMI clients initiate these operations through these protocols:

   * The WS-Management protocol
   * The local Binary protocol.
   * The CIM-XML protocol (not supported yet).

The server accepts client requests and routes them to the appropriate
provider.  Provider responses are routed back to the requesting client.

1.4 License
===========

OMI software is currently freely available for use by anyone under the
terms of the Apache 2.0 license
(<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt>).

1.5 Supported Platforms
=======================

OMI supports the following platforms.

   * HP-UX 11i v2 and v3 (PA-RISC and IA64)
   * Sun Solaris 8 and 9 (SPARC) and Solaris 10 (SPARC and x86)
   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (x86/x64) and 5 (x86/x64) Server
   * Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 (x86) and 10 SP1 (x86/x64)
   * IBM AIX v5.3 and v6.1 (POWER)
   * MacOS 10.5 (Intel)

OMI also builds on Windows with a few functional limitations.

1.6 Server Footprint
====================

OMI was expressly designed to work on very small systems.  Conventional
CIM servers are too large for embedded and mobile operating systems, but
OMI will fit easily on these systems.  Memory consumption is low, and
the object size of the server is less than 265 kilobytes when built with
the following flags:

     # ./configure --favorsize --enable-32bit \
        --disable-localsession --enable-sections

Additional size savings can be achieved by disabling other features if
appropriate.

2 Building and Installing
*************************

This chapter explains how to build and install OMI. It assumes you have
obtained the OMI source distribution ('omi-1.0.0.tar').

Note: Throughout this manual, we use 'omi-1.0.0' to represent the OMI
version that you are using.  In any of the examples provided, you should
replace 'omi-1.0.0' with your actual OMI version.

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

OMI depends on the following software.  Be sure these are installed on
your system before building.

   * GNU make
   * Native C and C++ compiler
   * OpenSSL headers and libraries
   * PAM headers and libraries

2.2 Overview
============

The following commands build and install OMI (these steps are expounded
in the sections below).  Note again that you should replace 'omi-1.0.0'
with the release version of OMI that you are using.

     # tar xf omi-1.0.0.tar
     # cd omi-1.0.0
     # ./configure
     # make
     # make install

The 'make install' command installs all files under the '/opt/omi-1.0.0'
directory.

2.3 Unpacking the source distribution
=====================================

The OMI source distribution is a 'tar' file.  Unpack the distribution
with the 'tar' utility as follows:

     # tar xf omi-1.0.0.tar

This command creates a directory named 'omi-1.0.0', which contains the
source distribution.

2.4 Configuring the build
=========================

To configure the build, run the './configure' script from the root of
the source distribution.  Type the following to print a help message
explaining how to use the script.

     # ./configure --help

This will also list any new options that have been added in recent
releases of OMI.

The options allow you to change where components are installed.  For
example, to install the programs under '/usr/local/bin' and everything
else under '/opt/omi', configure as follows.

     # ./configure --prefix=/opt/omi --bindir=/usr/local/bin

The default 'prefix' is '/usr/omi-1.0.0'.  After installing, you will
find all OMI programs (with a 'omi' prefix) under '/usr/local/bin'.

2.5 Configuring the build outside the source distribution
=========================================================

OMI 1.0.6 added support for configuring the build outside of the source
distribution.  To do this, create a build directory outside of the
source distribution and then invoke the 'configure' script from that
build directory using a relative path.  For example (assuming version
1.0.6):

     # tar xvf omi-1.0.6.tar
     # mkdir build
     # cd build
     # ../omi-1.0.6/configure
     # make

2.6 Building the distribution
=============================

After configuring, build by typing 'make', where 'make' refers to GNU
make.  For example:

     # make

This builds all components.

2.7 Installing the distribution
===============================

After building the source distribution, install by typing:

     # make install

You may configure and build as any user.  But you must install as root
since the install script creates files under root-owned directories.
Even if the '--prefix' option specifies a non-root owned directory, the
PAM authentication file ('omi.pam') must be copied to a root-owned
directory.

2.8 Uninstalling the distribution
=================================

Note that wherever OMI is installed, you will find a script called
'omiuninstall'.  This script removes all installed components, but
leaves any third-party components (_e.g._  providers and registration
files) intact.

2.9 Installing under DESTDIR
============================

Sometimes it is useful to install all the components under a "DESTDIR"
for the purposes of building an RPM or deploying the binaries to a
target machine.  For example, consider these steps:

     $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/abc
     $ make
     $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/destdir

So instead of installing under:

     /opt/abc

OMI is installed under here instead:

     /tmp/destdir/opt/abc

This procedure isolates all of the installable files for packaging or
for building an install manifest.

Following the example above, a binary distribution for a given platform
can be created as follows:

     $ cd /tmp/destdir/
     $ tar cvf omi-1.0.0-linux-x86.tar opt

Later this can be installed by simply un-tar-ing the package in the root
directory of a Linux system.

2.10 Installation layout
========================

After installing, you will find the installed files in the locations
specified by the './configure' options.  For example, if you configured
with './configure --prefix=/opt/omi', you will find the following files
after installing.

     /opt/omi/bin/omicli
     /opt/omi/bin/omigen
     /opt/omi/bin/omireg
     /opt/omi/bin/omiserver
     /opt/omi/bin/omiagent
     /opt/omi/etc/ssl/certs/omi.pem
     /opt/omi/etc/ssl/certs/omikey.pem
     /opt/omi/etc/omicli.conf
     /opt/omi/etc/omiregister/root-omi/omiidentify.reg
     /opt/omi/etc/omigen.conf
     /opt/omi/etc/omiserver.conf
     /opt/omi/lib/libmicxx.so
     /opt/omi/lib/libomiclient.so
     /opt/omi/lib/libomiidentify.so
     /opt/omi/share/omischema/CIM_Schema.mof
     ...
     /opt/omi/share/omi.mak
     /opt/omi/include/MI.h
     /opt/omi/include/omiclient/handler.h
     /opt/omi/include/omiclient/linkage.h
     /opt/omi/include/omiclient/client.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/atomic.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/propertyset.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/dinstance.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/instance.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/field.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/context.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/datetime.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/micxx.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/types.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/arraytraits.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/array.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/linkage.h
     /opt/omi/include/micxx/string.h

In addition to these files, the installer also copies a PAM (Pluggable
Authentication Module) file called 'omi.pam' under the '/etc/pam'
directory.

The following sections discuss these installed files.

2.10.1 'bin'
------------

The 'bin' directory contains all OMI programs, including:

   * 'omiserver' - the server program.
   * 'omiagent' - the provider agent program.
   * 'omigen' - the provider generation tool.
   * 'omireg' - the provider registration tool.
   * 'omicli' - the command-line client tool.

2.10.2 'etc'
------------

The 'etc' directory contains system-wide configuration files used by
various programs, including:

   * 'omicli.conf' - configuration file for omicli program.
   * 'omigen.conf' - configuration file for omigen program.
   * 'omiserver.conf' - configuration file for omiserver program.

The 'omicli' and 'omigen' programs look first for configuration files
named '.omiclirc' and '.omigenrc' in the current and home directories
(in which case the system-wide configuration file is ignored).

2.10.3 'lib'
------------

The 'lib' directory contains libraries.  These include:

   * 'libmi.so' - The C-language MI API support library.  'libmicxx.so'
     - the C++ provider support library (_Note that this library has
     been deprecated_).
   * 'libomiclient.so' - the C++ binary protocol client library.
   * 'libomiidentify.so' - the identify provider (OMI_Identify class).

2.10.4 'include'
----------------

The 'include' directory contains C and C++ header files required for
provider and client application development.  These include:

   * 'MI.h' - C provider header file.
   * 'micxx/micxx.h' - main C++ provider header file (_Note that this
     has been deprecated_).
   * 'omiclient/client.h' - main C++ client header file.

2.10.5 'omischema'
------------------

The 'omischema' directory contains MOF files that define the CIM schema.
These files are used by the provider generator tool ('omigen') while
generating provider sources.  The directory contains hundreds of MOF
files.  The main MOF file is called 'CIM_Schema.mof' (which includes all
others).

As of omi-1.0.8, the CIM schema version being used is CIM-2.32.0.

2.10.6 'etc/ssl/certs'
----------------------

The 'etc/ssl/certs' directory contains PEM-formatted certificates for
SSL (private and public).  These include:

   * 'omi.pem' - the public certificate.
   * 'omikey.pem' - the private certificate/key.

2.10.7 'etc/omiregister'
------------------------

The 'etc/omiregister' directory contains a namespace directory for each
CIM namespace.  Each namespace directory has the same name as the
corresponding CIM namespace, except '/' characters are translated to '-'
characters.  For example, for the CIM namespace 'root/cimv2', there is a
directory named 'root-cimv2'.  The server scans the 'etc/omiregister'
directory during startup to obtain a list of supported namespaces.

Each namespace directory contains provider registration files (with a
'.reg' extension).  Each registration file corresponds to a single
provider library.  These files are created by the 'omireg' utility.  The
following registration file (named 'omiidentify.reg') registers a
provider that implements the 'OMI_Identify' class.

     LIBRARY=omiidentify
     CLASS=OMI_Identify

Placing this file in the 'etc/omiregister/root-omi' directory, registers
the provider for that namespace.  The server scans all namespace
directories to discover provider registrations during startup.

2.10.8 'share'
--------------

The 'share' directory contains the 'omi.mak' file.  This file is
included by provider makefiles generated by the 'omigen' tool.

3 Using the server
******************

This chapter explains how to use the server program.  It explains how to
start, validate, and stop the server.  It also explains various options
and where to find the log files.

3.1 Setting up your path
========================

You may run each program by specifying its fully-qualified path, or for
convenience, you may wish to add the 'bin' directory to your path.  The
examples below assume you have done so.

3.2 Getting help
================

To get help with server options, type the following.

     # omiserver -h

This prints a help message that explains the usage, arguments, and
options.

3.3 Starting the server
=======================

To start the server in the foreground, type this.

     # omiserver

To start the server in the background, use the '-d' (daemonize) option.

     # omiserver -d

Multiple instances of the server may run on the same host subject to the
following constraints:

   * Each server is built with a distinct installation prefix, so that
     each server has a unique PID file and socket file paths.
   * Each server binds to a distinct port.  The port may be set with the
     '--port' command-line option or 'port' configuration file option.

If these constraints are not met, attempting to run a second server
results in an "already running" message.

3.4 Validating the server
=========================

To validate that the server is working correctly, use the 'omicli' tool
to send it a request.  Type 'omicli -h' for help with this tool.  When
initially installed, the server only has one provider, which provides
the 'OMI_Identify' class.  To enumerate all instances of this class,
type the following command ('id' is short for 'identify').

     # omicli id

If the server is working properly, this command should print a single
instance to standard output.  For example (if the OMI version were
1.0.0):

     instance of OMI_Identify
     {
         [Key] InstanceID=2FDB5542-5896-45D5-9BE9-DC04430AAABE
         SystemName=linux
         ProductName=OMI 1.0.0
         ProductVendor=Microsoft
         ProductVersionMajor=1
         ProductVersionMinor=0
         ProductVersionRevision=0
         ProductVersionString=1.0.0
         Platform=LINUX_IX86_GNU
         OperatingSystem=LINUX
         Architecture=IX86
         Compiler=GNU
         ConfigPrefix=/tmp/omi
         ConfigLibDir=/tmp/omi/lib
         ConfigBinDir=/tmp/omi/bin
         ConfigIncludeDir=/tmp/omi/include
         ConfigDataDir=/tmp/omi/share
         ConfigLocalStateDir=/tmp/omi/var
         ConfigSysConfDir=/tmp/omi/etc
         ConfigProviderDir=/tmp/omi/etc
         ConfigLogFile=/tmp/omi/var/log/omiserver.log
         ConfigPIDFile=/tmp/omi/var/run/omiserver.pid
         ConfigRegisterDir=/tmp/omi/etc/omiregister
         ConfigSchemaDir=/tmp/omi/share/omischema
         ConfigNameSpaces={root-omi, interop, root-cimv2}
     }

This instance identifies various characteristics of the server and
system.

3.5 Stopping the server
=======================

To stop the server, type the following.

     # omiserver -s

This stops the server by sending a signal to the process whose process
id (pid) is contained in 'var/run/omiserver.pid'.  The server removes
this file when it shuts down.

3.6 Server and Agent Logs
=========================

To enable logging, start 'omiserver' with the option: '–loglevel
<level number>'.  To generate HTTP 'trc' files, start 'omiserver' with
the option: '–httptrace'.  Without these options, logging and 'trc'
files will not be enabled.

Server log messages are directed to 'var/log/omiserver.log'.  The server
spawns agent processes ('omiagent') in order to run providers as
specified users (determined by the provider hosting model).  Log
messages from agents are written to files whose name has the form:

     var/log/omiagent.<UID>.<GID>.log

'<UID>' and '<GID>' are the user id and group id of the agent process's
owner.  To browse logs, look for files under 'var/log' whose name
matches 'omi*'.

3.7 Server file and directory locations
=======================================

Sometimes it is helpful to know where the server expects to find various
files.  Where is the server log file?  Where is the provider
registration directory?  To obtain a list of server and file locations,
type the following command.

     # omiserver -p

Running this on a system where OMI was installed under '/opt/omi' prints
the following.

     prefix=/opt/omi
     libdir=/opt/omi/lib
     bindir=/opt/omi/bin
     localstatedir=/opt/omi/var
     sysconfdir=/opt/omi/etc
     providerdir=/opt/omi/lib
     certsdir=/opt/omi/etc/ssl/certs
     datadir=/opt/omi/share
     rundir=/opt/omi/var/run
     logdir=/opt/omi/var/log
     schemadir=/opt/omi/share/omischema
     schemafile=/opt/omi/share/omischema/CIM_Schema.mof
     pidfile=/opt/omi/var/run/omiserver.pid
     logfile=/opt/omi/var/log/omiserver.log
     registerdir=/opt/omi/etc/omiregister
     pemfile=/opt/omi/etc/ssl/certs/omi.pem
     keyfile=/opt/omi/etc/ssl/certs/omikey.pem
     agentprogram=/opt/omi/bin/omiagent
     serverprogram=/opt/omi/bin/omiserver
     includedir=/opt/omi/include
     configfile=/opt/omi/etc/omiserver.conf
     socketfile=/opt/omi/var/omiserver.sock

4 Using the command-line client ('omicli')
******************************************

This chapter explains how to use the command-line client tool.  This
tool sends requests to the local CIM server and prints the responses to
standard output.  For example, 'omicli ei root/omi OMI_Identify' sends
the 'ei' request ('enumerate-instances') to the server and then prints
the following on standard output (assuming, here, that the OMI version
is 1.0.0):

     instance of OMI_Identify
     {
         [Key] InstanceID=2FDB5542-5896-45D5-9BE9-DC04430AAABE
         SystemName=linux
         ProductName=OMI 1.0.0
         ProductVendor=Microsoft
         ProductVersionMajor=1
         ProductVersionMinor=0
         ProductVersionRevision=0
         ProductVersionString=1.0.0
         Platform=LINUX_IX86_GNU
         OperatingSystem=LINUX
         Architecture=IX86
         Compiler=GNU
         ConfigPrefix=/tmp/omi
         ConfigLibDir=/tmp/omi/lib
         ConfigBinDir=/tmp/omi/bin
         ConfigIncludeDir=/tmp/omi/include
         ConfigDataDir=/tmp/omi/share
         ConfigLocalStateDir=/tmp/omi/var
         ConfigSysConfDir=/tmp/omi/etc
         ConfigProviderDir=/tmp/omi/etc
         ConfigLogFile=/tmp/omi/var/log/omiserver.log
         ConfigPIDFile=/tmp/omi/var/run/omiserver.pid
         ConfigRegisterDir=/tmp/omi/etc/omiregister
         ConfigSchemaDir=/tmp/omi/share/omischema
         ConfigNameSpaces={root-omi, interop, root-cimv2}
     }

Each 'instance of { ... }' construct represents an instance of a CIM
class.  The braces contain properties and their values.  Key properties
are annotated with the 'Key' qualifier.

The general usage of the tool is:

     # omicli COMMAND ARGUMENTS

The 'COMMAND' is one of the following:

   * 'noop' - send a no-op request to the server.
   * 'gi' - send a get-instance request to the server.
   * 'ci' - send a create-instance request to the server.
   * 'mi' - send a modify-instance request to the server.
   * 'di' - send a delete-instance request to the server.
   * 'ei' - send an enumerate-instances request to the server.
   * 'iv' - send an invoke (extrinsic method) request to the server.
   * 'a' - send an associators request to the server.
   * 'r' - send an references request to the server.
   * 'id' - send an identify request to the server.

The 'ARGUMENTS' are command-specific and are described below.

4.1 Getting help on options
===========================

To print a help message, type the following.

     # omicli -h

The message explains the syntax of key commands.

4.2 The socket file
===================

By default, when 'omicli' and 'omiserver' are built together (with the
same prefix), the 'omicli' program contains the location of the server's
socket file.  But when they are built separately, or if you want to
communicate with multiple instances of the server, you must specify the
socket file location using the '--socketfile' option.  The socket file
is located here: '*/var/run/omiserver.sock', where '*' is the prefix the
server was built with.

4.3 The No-Op request
=====================

The following command sends a no-op request to the server.

     # omicli noop

This tests whether the server is running and responsive.  If so, it
prints a message indicating success.  If the server is not responsive,
the command will time out.

4.4 Enumerating Instances
=========================

The following command enumerates instances of 'OMI_Identify' within the
'root/omi' namespace.

     # omicli ei root/omi OMI_Identify

4.5 Getting an Instance
=======================

The following command gets a single instance of the 'OMI_Identify' class
from the 'root/omi' namespace.

     # omicli gi root/omi \
       { OMI_Identify InstanceID 2FDB5542-5896-45D5-9BE9-DC04430AAABE }

The expression in braces represents the instance name for the given
instance.  This instance name has a single key, although an instance
name may have multiple keys.  Consider, for example, the following class
with two keys.

     class MyClass
     {
         [Key] String  Key1;
         [Key] Uint32  Key2;
               Boolean Value;
         ...
     };

And now consider the following instance of that class.

     instance of MyClass
     {
         Key1=XYZ
         Key2=123
         Value=false
         ...
     };

The instance name for this instance is expressed as follows on the
command line.

     { MyClass Key1 XYZ Key2 123 *Value false }

Note that non-key names (such as Value) are prefixed with an asterisk.

In general, instance names are expressed as a class name followed by
name-value pairs, all enclosed in brackets.  Failing to specify values
for a complete set of keys results in an error.

4.6 Invoking a method
=====================

To invoke an extrinsic method, use the 'iv' command, whose usage is:

     # omicli iv NAMESPACE INSTANCENAME METHODNAME PARAMETERS

For example, consider the 'SetState' extrinsic method defined by the
following CIM class.

     class OMI_Frog
     {
         [Key] Uint32 Key;

         Uint32 SetState(
             [In] String NewState,
             [In(false), Out] String OutState);
     };

The following command invokes the 'SetState' method on the instance of
'OMI_Frog' named '{ OMI_Frog Key 123 }'.

     # omicli iv root/omi { OMI_Frog Key 123 } SetState { NewState Hopping }

This command prints any output parameters to standard output.  For
example, the above command might print this:

     { OldState Sitting }

4.7 Subscribing to an Indication
================================

Use the 'queryexpr="select"' statement to subscribe to an indication, as
illustrated below.

4.7.1 Subscribing to an alert Indication
----------------------------------------

An alert indication class derives from the standard 'CIM_Indication'
class.  For instance:

     class XYZ_DiskFault : CIM_Indication
     {
       string detailmessage;
     };

In order to subscribe to this 'XYZ_DiskFault' indication class, run:

     # omicli sub root/sample -queryexpr="select * from XYZ_DiskFault"

4.7.2 Subscribing to a lifecycle Indication
-------------------------------------------

Consider as an example a class derived from CIM_Process:

     class XYZ_Process : CIM_Process
     {
       uint32 runningTime;

       [static]
       uint32 Create( [in] string imageName, [out] CIM_Process REF process );
       uint32 GetRunTime( [in] uint32 pid, [out] uint32 runningTime );
     };

To subscribe to the lifecycle creation indication for instances of the
'XYZ_Process' indication class, run:

     # omicli sub root/sample -queryexpr="select * \
       from CIM_InstCreation \
       where SourceInstance ISA XYZ_Process"

5 Using the client library 'omiclient'
**************************************

The 'omiclient' client library defines a C++ API that enables client
applications to connect to and send requests to the CIM server.  It uses
a local binary protocol for communicating with the CIM server.  As a
result, the client application must reside on the same host as the CIM
server.  This chapter explains how to get started using this library.

Please note, however, that the 'omiclient' client library is deprecated
and may not be supported in future releases.

5.1 Client library source examples
==================================

The following source files (under the source distribution) illustrate
how to use the client library.

     ./omiclient/tests/test_client.cpp
     ./cli/cli.cpp

The first is the unit test for the 'omiclient' library.  The second is
the main source file of the 'omicli' tool discussed above.  The examples
below show how to do simple things with the client library.  For more
detail, see these examples.

5.2 The 'omiclient' library
===========================

The base name of client library is 'omiclient'.  The full name is
platform dependent.  For example, on Linux the full name is
'libomiclient.so'.  This library resides in the 'lib' directory
(selected when the distribution was built).  The client application must
be linked with this library.

5.3 The '<omiclient/client.h>' header
=====================================

Client applications must include <omiclient/client.h>.  This header file
defines the full client interface.  It resides in the 'include'
directory (selected when the distribution was built).

5.4 Connecting to the local server
==================================

The first step is to connect to the local CIM server, illustrated by the
following program.

     01  #include <omiclient/client.h>
     02
     03  using namespace std;
     04
     05  int main()
     06  {
     07      const Uint64 timeout = 30000000;
     08
     09      Client c;
     10      String locator;
     11      String username;
     12      String password;
     13
     14      if (!c.Connect(locator, username, password, timeout))
     15      {
     16          // Error!
     17      }
     18
     29      return 0;
     20  }

Line 1 includes '<omiclient/client.h>', the main header file for the
client interface.  This header is located under the installation
'include' directory.  Consult this file to more details about the
interface.  Use of the 'omiclient' library is experimental.  The new C
client, 'miapi', provides the same functionality.

Line 9 instantiates an instance of the 'Client' class.  This function
takes an optional 'Handler' instance, which is required when calling the
asynchronous member functions.  The examples below use the synchronous
methods and so no handler is needed.

Line 14 establishes a synchronous connection with the local CIM server.
The 'Client::Connect' function takes four arguments: 'locator',
'username', 'password', and 'timeout'.  The 'locator' is a string that
specifies the Unix domain socket file used to connect to the server.  If
the 'locator' is empty, the client uses the default socket file, located
under the 'run' directory with the name 'omiserver.sock'.

To connect to a server whose socket file is not in the default location,
set the location parameter to the the full path of that socket file,
such as '/opt/omi/var/run/omiserver.sock'.

The 'username' and 'password' parameters are used to authenticate the
user with the server.  There are two kinds of authentication: explicit
and implicit.  With *explicit* authentication, the 'username' and
'password' parameters hold the log on credentials for a given user.
With *implicit* authentication, these parameters are empty, in which
case the user is authenticated using the identity of the current user
(obtained with the 'getuid' system call).

The 'timeout' parameter specifies how long to wait (in microseconds)
before failing.  In this example, the timeout is 30 seconds (30,000,000
microseconds).

Developers may call the 'Client::Disconnect()' method to explicitly
disconnect from the server.  Otherwise, the connection is closed
implicitly by the 'Client' destructor.

5.5 Enumerating instances
=========================

The code fragment below enumerates instances of the 'OMI_Identify'
class.

     01      const String nameSpace = "root/omi";
     02      const String className = "OMI_Identify";
     03      const bool deepInheritance = true;
     04      const Uint64 timeout = 2000000;
     05      Array<DInstance> instances;
     06      MI_Result result;
     07
     08      if (!c.EnumerateInstances(nameSpace, className, deepInheritance,
     09          timeout, instances, result))
     10      {
     11          // Error!
     12      }
     13
     14      if (result != MI_RESULT_OK)
     15      {
     16          // Error!
     17      }
     18
     19      for (Uint32 i = 0; i < instances.GetSize(); i++)
     20          instances[i].Print();

Line 8 performs an enumeration request.  It obtains instances of the
given class from the given namespace.  The resulting instances are in
the 'instances' parameter upon return.

The 'deepInheritance' parameter specifies whether to return instances of
classes derived from 'OMI_Identify' (if true) or to return instances of
'OMI_Identify' only (if false).

Line 19 through 20 print the resulting instances.

Use 'EnumerateInstances' with regard for memory usage.  It places all
instances into memory at once, which may exhaust available memory when
there are many thousands of instances.  To avoid memory exhaustion, use
the asynchronous form, called 'EnumerateInstancesAsync'.  All
asynchronous functions use the 'Handler' class, which defines virtual
functions for delivering instances one at a time.  See Appendix B for a
fully asynchronous example.

5.6 Getting a single instance
=============================

The code fragment below shows how to get a single instance from the
server.

     01  // Construct an instance name:
     02  const String className = "OMI_Identify";
     03  DInstance instanceName(className, DInstance::CLASS);
     04
     05  // Add a key property:
     06  const String propertyName = "InstanceID";
     07  const String instanceID = "2FDB5542-5896-45D5-9BE9-DC04430AAABE";
     08  const String isNull = false;
     09  const String isKey = true;
     10  instanceName.AddUint32(propertyName, instanceID, isNull, isKey);
     11
     12  // Perform get instance:
     13  const String nameSpace = "root/omi";
     14  const Uint64 TIMEOUT = 2000000;
     15  DInstance instance;
     16  MI_Result result;
     17  if (!c.GetInstance(nameSpace, instanceName, TIMEOUT, instance,
     18      result))
     19  {
     20      // Error!
     21  }
     22
     23  if (result != MI_RESULT_OK)
     24  {
     25      // Error!
     26  }
     27
     28  instance.Print();

Lines 1 through 10 build an instance name (using the 'DInstance' class).
Lines 2 through 3 construct a 'DInstance' whose class name is
'OMI_Identify'.  Lines 6 through 10 add a key property to the instance
name called 'InstanceID'.

Lines 13 through 18 perform the get instance request.  Upon return, the
'instance' parameter contains the result.

Finally, Line 28 prints the resulting instance to standard output.

5.7 Invoking an extrinsic method
================================

This section shows how to invoke an extrinsic method.  Recall the
definition of the 'OMI_Frog' class.

     class OMI_Frog
     {
         [Key] Uint32 Key;

         Uint32 SetState(
             [In] String NewState,
             [In(false), Out] String OutState);
     };

The code fragment shows how to invoke the 'OMI_Frog.SetState' method.

     01  // Initialize instance name:
     02  DInstance instanceName("OMI_Frog", DInstance::CLASS);
     03  instanceName.AddUint32("Key", 123, false, true);
     04
     05  // Initialize input parameters:
     06  DInstance in(T("SetState"), DInstance::METHOD);
     07  in.AddString(T("NewState"), "Hopping", false, false);
     08
     09  // Invoke method:
     10  const Uint64 TIMEOUT = 5000000;
     11  DInstance out;
     12  MI_Result result;
     13
     14  if (!c.Invoke(
     15      "root/omi",
     16      instanceName,
     17      "SetState",
     18      in,
     19      TIMEOUT,
     20      out,
     21      result))
     22  {
     23      // Error!
     24  }
     25
     26  if (result != MI_RESULT_OK)
     27  {
     28      // Error!
     29  }
     30
     31  out.Print();

Lines 2 through 3 initialize the instance name, which identifies the
instance of 'OMI_Frog' whose method will be called.  This specifies a
single key named 'Key' with the value '123'.

Lines 6 through 7 initialize the input parameters for the method.  In
this example, there is a single parameter named 'NewState' with the
value 'Hopping'.

Lines 14 through 21 invoke the 'SetState' method.  Upon return, 'out'
holds any output parameters (the 'OldState' parameter in this case).
The 'out' parameter always has a parameter named 'MIReturn', which
contains the return value of the function (the return value of
'OMI_Frog.SetState' in this example).  In CIM, all functions are
required to return a value.

6 Using the MI 'miapi' client library and/or 'libmi.so'
*******************************************************

Note: This information in this chapter is experimental.

6.1 Introduction to the MI Library
==================================

MI on Windows is the Windows Management Infrastructure, also known as
WMIv2.  It is documented online in the MSDN Library, at
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj152383.aspx>.

For OMI, the 'miapi' client library can be used by including 'MI.h' in
your C source file:

     #include <MI.h>

and by adding the following flags in the GNUmakefile:

     –L$Omi/lib –lmi

6.1.1 CDXML
-----------

MI introduces CDXML (cmdlet-definition XML), an XML schema for mapping
Windows PowerShell cmdlets to CIM class operations or methods.
PowerShell cmdlet developers use CDXML files to define cmdlets that call
a CIM Object Manager (CIMOM) server such as WMI in Windows to manage the
server.  Cmdlets defined in CDXML communicate with remote CIM servers
using the WsMan protocol, implemented by the WinRM service in Windows.
This enables management of end-points that don't have PowerShell
installed on them, such as a computer running Windows Server with
PowerShell remoting disabled, or a computer running a CIM server like
OMI or other CIM server software.

For documentation of CDXML, see
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj542522.aspx>.

6.1.2 The MI Application Programming Interface (API)
----------------------------------------------------

The Management Infrastructure API contains the interfaces, enumerations,
structures, and unions used to developer native WMI providers and
clients.  It is documented online at
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh404805(v=vs.85).aspx>.

6.2 Samples illustrating MI library operations
==============================================

Examples of MI operations performed using the OMI libraries are located
in the OMI distribution in the 'samples/MIAPI' folder.  In general,
these examples show how to perform each operation both synchronously and
asynchronously.

The synchronous example generally calls 'MI_Operation_GetInstance' in a
loop to iterate through the results of the operation, whereas the
asynchronous example initializes a 'MI_OperationCallbacks' structure
with the event and callbacks needed to process the results
asynchronously.

The following operations are illustrated:

   * GetInstance - The 'get.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_GetInstance'.
   * EnumerateInstances - The 'enumerate.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_EnumerateInstances'.
   * CreateInstance - The 'create.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_CreateInstance'.
   * DeleteInstance - The 'delete.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_DeleteInstance'.
   * ModifyInstance - The 'modify.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_ModifyInstance'.
   * Associators - The 'association.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_AssociatorInstances'.
   * Invoke - The 'invoke.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_Invoke'.
   * References - The 'reference.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_ReferenceInstances'.
   * Subscribe - The 'subscribe.c' file shows how to use
     'MI_Session_Subscribe'.

7 Developing a provider in 5 minutes
************************************

This chapter provides a very quick overview of the provider development
process.  It shows the minimum steps for building a simple instance
provider.  For a more complete discussion of provider development, see
the next chapter.

Appendix A contains a complete listing of all file in this example.
These files are also included in the source distribution under
'omi-1.0.0/doc/omi/samples/frog' (assuming OMI version 1.0.0).

7.1 Defining 'schema.mof'
=========================

First we define the class schema shown in the 'schema.mof' file below.

     class XYZ_Frog
     {
         [Key] String Name;
         Uint32 Weight;
         String Color;
     };

7.2 Generating the provider sources
===================================

Next we generate the provider sources and the makefile using the command
below.

     someuser@linux:~/gadget> omigen --cpp -m frog schema.mof XYZ_Frog
     Creating XYZ_Frog.h
     Creating XYZ_Frog_Class_Provider.h
     Creating XYZ_Frog_Class_Provider.cpp
     Creating schema.c
     Creating stubs.cpp
     Creating module.cpp
     Creating module.h
     Creating GNUmakefile

7.2.1 A Note about Context Object Lifetime
------------------------------------------

The 'stubs.cpp' file that 'omigen' produces contains wrapper functions
that encapsulate an 'MI_Context*' pointer within a context object, and
passes that context into the cpp skeleton as a reference.

Because the context object lives on the stack, however, it is destroyed
as soon as the call rewinds to the caller.  Therefore, if a provider
needs to save the context and use it later, the provider must use a copy
of the context instead of the reference to it (which is actually a
pointer).

In the following example, for instance, the call that creates a new
'SCX_Agent_ThreadParam' passes in 'context.context( )' rather than just
'context':

     MI_EXTERN_C void MI_CALL SCX_Agent_EnumerateInstances(
         SCX_Agent_Self* self,
         MI_Context* context,
         const MI_Char* nameSpace,
         const MI_Char* className,
         const MI_PropertySet* propertySet,
         MI_Boolean keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter )
     {
        SCX_Agent_Class_Provider* cxxSelf =((SCX_Agent_Class_Provider*)self);
        Context  cxxContext(context);

        cxxSelf->EnumerateInstances(
            cxxContext,
            nameSpace,
            __PropertySet(propertySet),
            __bool(keysOnly),
            filter );
     }

     void SCX_Agent_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
       SCX_PEX_BEGIN
       {
         std::wcout << "EnumerateInstances: Context: "
                    << &context
                    << ", keysOnly: "
                    << keysOnly
                    << std::endl;
         SCX_Agent_ThreadParam* params =
             new SCX_Agent_ThreadParam( context.context( ), keysOnly );
         new SCXCoreLib::SCXThread( EnumerateInstancesThreadBody, params );
       }
       SCX_PEX_END( L"SCX_Agent_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances",
                    SCXCore::g_MetaProvider.GetLogHandle( ) );
     }

7.3 Implementing the 'EnumerateInstances' stub
==============================================

Next we implement the 'EnumerateInstances' stub.  The generated stub
looks like this:

     void XYZ_Frog_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

The implementation below provides two frogs.

     void XYZ_Frog_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         XYZ_Frog_Class frog1;
         frog1.Name_value("Fred");
         frog1.Weight_value(55);
         frog1.Color_value("Green");
         context.Post(frog1);

         XYZ_Frog_Class frog2;
         frog2.Name_value("Sam");
         frog2.Weight_value(65);
         frog2.Color_value("Blue");
         context.Post(frog2);

         context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
     }

Note: In CIM, a property either has a value or is null (has no value).
The 'XYZ_Frog.Name_exists' function returns true if the 'Frog.Name'
property has a value or false if the property is null (has no value).
If the property has a value, one may call the 'XYZ_Frog.Name_value'
function to obtain it.

7.4 Registering the provider
============================

Next we register the provider as follows:

     # make reg
     /opt/omi/bin/omireg libfrog.so
     Copied provider to /opt/omi/lib/libfrog.so
     Created /opt/omi/etc/omiregister/root-cimv2/frog.reg

This creates 'frog.reg' under the registration directory for the default
namespace 'root/cimv2' and it copies the provider to the installed
directory.

7.5 Testing the provider
========================

To test the provider, send an enumerate request to the provider as shown
below.

     # omicli ei root/cimv2 XYZ_Frog
     instance of XYZ_Frog
     {
         [Key] Name=Fred
         Weight=55
         Color=Green
     }
     instance of XYZ_Frog
     {
         [Key] Name=Sam
         Weight=65
         Color=Blue
     }

7.6 Going further
=================

While this chapter has given a brief overview of the provider
development process, the next chapter goes into provider development in
more detail.

8 Developing providers
**********************

This chapter shows how to develop providers, a process consisting of 6
stages:

   * Defining the MOF schema
   * Generating the provider sources
   * Implementing the provider operations
   * Building the provider
   * Registering the provider
   * Validating the provider

We discuss each stage, showing how to develop providers that implement
the following operations:

   * *get-instance*
   * *enumerate-instances*
   * *associator-names*
   * *reference-names*
   * *invoke-method*

OMI supports two provider language bindings: C and C++.  This chapter
only shows how to use the C++ binding.  Whether you build C or C++
providers, the development stages are the same although the details of
the interface vary.  For more information about the C interface, see the
'<MI/MI.h>' header file and experiment with generating C providers.

8.1 Defining the MOF schema
===========================

The first stage is to define the MOF classes comprising your schema.
You may extend an existing CIM class like this:

     class XYZ_MyComputerSystem : CIM_ComputerSystem
     {
         ...
     };

Or you may define a new root class (with no super class):

     class MyClass
     {
         ...
     };

The MOF language is defined in the CIM Infrastructure Specification
(DSP0004), which may be found at (<http://dmtf.org/standards/cim>).

The provider developed below implements the following class definitions
(which are placed in a file called 'schema.mof').

     // schema.mof

     class XYZ_Widget
     {
         [Key] Uint32 Key;
         Uint32 ModelNumber;
         String Color;
     };

     class XYZ_Gadget
     {
         [Key] Uint32 Key;
         Uint32 ModelNumber;
         Uint32 Size;

         Uint32 ChangeState(
             [In] Uint32 NewState,
             [In(False), Out] Uint32 OldState);
     };

     [Association]
     class XYZ_Connector
     {
         [Key] XYZ_Widget REF Left;
         [Key] XYZ_Gadget REF Right;
     };

Notice that all classes define above have the 'XYZ_' prefix.  Similarly,
all classes in the CIM schema begin have the 'CIM_' prefix.  All classes
should have a suitable prefix but for brevity, this prefix is omitted
henceforth.

The 'Connector' class is an association, as indicated by the
'Associator' qualifier.  Each instance of 'Connector', connects one
instance of 'Widget' with one instance of 'Gadget'.

8.2 Generating the provider sources
===================================

The second stage involves generating the provider sources.  The
following command generates provider sources from the 'schema.mof' file
defined above.

     omigen --cpp -m xyzconnector schema.mof \
        XYZ_Gadget=Gadget XYZ_Widget=Widget XYZ_Connector=Connector
     Creating Gadget.h
     Creating Gadget_Class_Provider.h
     Creating Gadget_Class_Provider.cpp
     Creating Widget.h
     Creating Widget_Class_Provider.h
     Creating Widget_Class_Provider.cpp
     Creating Connector.h
     Creating Connector_Class_Provider.h
     Creating Connector_Class_Provider.cpp
     Creating schema.c
     Creating stubs.cpp
     Creating module.cpp
     Creating module.h
     Creating GNUmakefile

The '--cpp' option creates 'C++' sources (instead of C sources by
default).  The '-m xyzconnector' option creates 'GNUmakefile' with rules
for building, regenerating, and registering the provider.  This makefile
creates a library whose base name is given by the '-m' option
('xyzconnector').

Tip: You may regenerate sources by typing 'make gen' or by retyping the
command above.  The generator will never overwrite editable files.
Instead it attempts to patch them.  Some files are non-editable and are
regenerated completely.

The generator creates sources for classes 'XYZ_Gadget', 'XYZ_Widget',
and 'XYZ_Connector'.  The command above defines aliases for each class
name, allowing shorter names to be used throughout the source code.  For
example, 'XYZ_Gadget=Gadget' causes 'Gadget.h' to be generated instead
of 'XYZ_Gadget.h'.  Alias can be used to completely rename a class.  For
example: 'CIM_ComputerSystem=CompSys'.

To learn more about the 'omigen' options, type 'omigen -h' to print a
help message.

The purpose of each generated file is given below.

   * 'Gadget.h' - defines C++ class for the CIM 'Gadget' class.
   * 'Widget.h' - defines C++ class for the CIM 'Widget' class.
   * 'Connector.h' - defines C++ class for the CIM 'Connector' class.
   * 'Gadget_Class_Provider.h' - defines 'Gadget_Class_Provider' class.
   * 'Gadget_Class_Provider.cpp' - defines 'Gadget_Class_Provider'
     class.
   * 'Widget_Class_Provider.h' - defines 'Widget_Class_Provider' class.
   * 'Widget_Class_Provider.cpp' - defines 'Widget_Class_Provider'
     class.
   * 'Connector_Class_Provider.h' - defines 'Connector_Class_Provider'
     class.
   * 'Connector_Class_Provider.cpp' - defines 'Connector_Class_Provider'
     class.
   * 'schema.c' - internal definitions.
   * 'stubs.cpp' - internal definitions.
   * 'module.cpp' - defines 'MI_Main' library entry point.
   * 'module.h' - defines 'Module' class.
   * 'GNUmakefile' - defines rules for building the provider library.

Many of these files are not intended to be edited.  Developer edits may
be made to the following files.

   * 'Gadget_Class_Provider.h'
   * 'Gadget_Class_Provider.cpp'
   * 'Widget_Class_Provider.h'
   * 'Widget_Class_Provider.cpp'
   * 'Connector_Class_Provider.h'
   * 'Connector_Class_Provider.cpp'
   * 'module.h'
   * 'module.cpp'

For example, to implement the 'get-instances' operation for the 'Gadget'
class, modify the 'Gadget_Class_Provider.cpp' file.

8.3 Implementing the provider operations
========================================

This section shows how to implement the following provider operations:

   * *get-instance*
   * *enumerate-instances*
   * *associator-names*
   * *reference-names*
   * *invoke-method*

8.3.1 Implementing enumerate-instances
--------------------------------------

This section implement the enumerate-instances operation for the
'Gadget' class.  This implementation provides the following instances
(shown in MOF format).

     instance of XYZ_Gadget
     {
         Key = 1003;
         ModelNumber = 3;
         Size = 33;
     };

     instance of XYZ_Gadget
     {
         Key = 1004;
         ModelNumber = 4;
         Size = 43;
     };

To implement the enumerate-instance operation for the 'Gadget' class,
start by examining the generated stub (see 'Gadget_Class_Provider.cpp').

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

This function is invoked by the CIM server.  The implementer may respond
on the same thread or he may create a new thread if the request is long
running.  The lifetime of the request is bound to the lifetime of the
'context' parameter.  All parameters remain in scope until the provider
calls 'Context::Post'.  The provider may create a new thread to handle
the request, in which case the parameters may live beyond the invocation
of 'EnumerateInstances'.

We provide an implementation that provides two instances of the 'Gadget'
class.  The following implementation handles the request on the calling
thread.

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         // Gadget.Key=1003:
         {
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);
             g.ModelNumber_value(3);
             g.Size_value(33);
             context.Post(g);
         }

         // Gadget.Key=1004:
         {
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1004);
             g.ModelNumber_value(4);
             g.Size_value(43);
             context.Post(g);
         }

         context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
     }

This function constructs instances of the 'Gadget' class and passes them
to the 'Context::Post' function.  When all instances have been posted,
the provider passes the result status to the 'Context::Post' function.
This finalizes the request.

Tip: By passing the '--nogi CLASSNAME' option (no get-instance) to the
generator tool, the server uses the 'enumerate-instances' implementation
to satisfy all 'get-instance' requests.  Only use this technique if the
number of instances is small, otherwise the provider will be very slow.

8.3.2 Implementing get-instance
-------------------------------

Next we show how to implement the 'get-instance' operation for the
'Gadget' class.  Here is the generated stub for the 'get-instance'
request.

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::GetInstance(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

The 'instanceName' parameter holds the keys for the target instance.
Here is the full implementation of this function.

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::GetInstance(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet)
     {
         if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1003)
         {
             // Gadget.Key=1003:
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);
             g.ModelNumber_value(3);
             g.Size_value(33);
             context.Post(g);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1004)
         {
             // Gadget.Key=1004:
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1004);
             g.ModelNumber_value(4);
             g.Size_value(43);
             context.Post(g);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else
         {
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_FOUND);
         }
     }

We examine the key and return the matching instance.  If neither
condition matches, we post the 'MI_RESULT_NOT_FOUND' result.

8.3.3 Implementing an extrinsic method
--------------------------------------

This section implements the 'ChangeState' extrinsic method.  The
generator produces the following stub.

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::Invoke_ChangeState(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const Gadget_ChangeState_Class& in)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

The 'instanceName' parameter is the instance whose 'ChangeState' method
has been invoked (this parameter is omitted for static methods).  The
'in' parameter contains the input parameters.  The implementation should
perform the following tasks:

   * Read the input parameters.
   * Perform the desired action.
   * Build the output parameters.
   * Set the return value.
   * Post the output parameters to the server.
   * Return a successful status.

The following implementation performs each of these steps.

     void Gadget_Class_Provider::Invoke_ChangeState(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const Gadget_ChangeState_Class& in)
     {
         Gadget_ChangeState_Class out;

         // Print the input parameter:
         if (in.NewState_exists())
         {
             printf("NewState=%u\n", in.NewState_value());
         }

         // Perform desired action here:
         ...

         // Set the output parameter:
         out.OldState_value(2);

         // Set the return value:
         out.MIReturn_value(0);

         // Post the "out" object.
         context.Post(out);

         // Post the result status.
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
     }

8.3.4 Implementing enumerate-instances for an association provider
------------------------------------------------------------------

This section shows how to implement the enumerate-instances operation
for the 'Connector' association class.  This operation produces the
following instances (shown in MOF format).

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1001";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1003";
     };

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1002";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1004";
     };

Here is the implementation.

     void Connector_Class_Provider::EnumerateInstances(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1001","Widget.Key=1003"
         {
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1001);
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);
             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);
             context.Post(c);
         }

         // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1002","Widget.Key=1004"
         {
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1002);
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1004);
             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);
             context.Post(c);
         }

         context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
     }

8.3.5 Implementing get-instances for an association class
---------------------------------------------------------

The following example implements 'get-instance' for the 'Connector'
association class.

     void Connector_Class_Provider::GetInstance(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Connector_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet)
     {
         if (instanceName.Left_value().Key_value() == 1001 &&
             instanceName.Right_value().Key_value() == 1003)
         {
             // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1001","Widget.Key=1003"
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1001);

             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);

             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);

             context.Post(c);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else if (instanceName.Left_value().Key_value() == 1002 &&
             instanceName.Right_value().Key_value() == 1004)
         {
             // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1002","Widget.Key=1004"
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1001);

             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);

             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);

             context.Post(c);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else
         {
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_FOUND);
         }
     }

Note that 'instanceName.Left_value()' returns an instance of type
'Gadget' (see MOF definitions).  And so
'instanceName.Left_value().Key_value()' returns the 'Key' property of
the associated 'Gadget' instance.

8.3.6 Implementing the associator-instances operation
-----------------------------------------------------

This section shows how to implement the associator-instances operation.
This operation finds the other end of an association.  For example, it
might find the 'Gadget' instances that are associated with a single
'Widget' instance (through a 'Connector' instance).  For example,
consider the following MOF definitions.

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left  = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1001";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1003";
     };

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left  = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1002";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1004";
     };

The associator-instances operation starts with the instance name of an
instance and finds associated instances.  For example, the
associator-instances of:

     XYZ_Widget.Key=1001

include:

     XYZ_Gadget.Key=1003

The generator produces two stubs to handle associator-instances
requests.  The first yields associators in which the 'instanceName'
parameter matches the first reference property ('Connector.Left').  The
second yields associations in which the 'instanceName' parameter matches
the second reference property ('Connector.Right').  The stubs are
defined as follows.

     void Connector_Class_Provider::AssociatorInstancesLeft(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Widget_Class& instanceName,
         const String& resultClass,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

     void Connector_Class_Provider::AssociatorInstancesRight(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const String& resultClass,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

The following implementation yields associators of 'Widget' instances.

     void Connector_Class_Provider::AssociatorInstancesLeft(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Widget_Class& instanceName,
         const String& resultClass,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1001)
         {
             // Gadget.Key=1003:
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);
             g.ModelNumber_value(3);
             g.Size_value(33);
             context.Post(g);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1002)
         {
             // Gadget.Key=1004:
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1004);
             g.ModelNumber_value(4);
             g.Size_value(43);
             context.Post(g);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else
         {
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_FOUND);
         }
     }

8.3.7 Implementing the reference-instances operation
----------------------------------------------------

The reference-instances operation takes an instance name and finds the
reference instances that refer to it.  Consider the following MOF
definitions.

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left  = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1001";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1003";
     };

     instance of XYZ_Connector
     {
         Left  = "XYZ_Widget.Key=1002";
         Right = "XYZ_Gadget.Key=1004";
     };

For example, the reference-instance of 'XYZ_Widget.Key=1001' includes
the first MOF instance shown above.  As with associator-instances, the
generator produces two stubs:

     void Connector_Class_Provider::ReferenceInstancesLeft(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Widget_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

     void Connector_Class_Provider::ReferenceInstancesRight(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Gadget_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED);
     }

The implementation of 'ReferenceInstancesLeft' is shown below.

     void Connector_Class_Provider::ReferenceInstancesLeft(
         Context& context,
         const String& nameSpace,
         const Widget_Class& instanceName,
         const PropertySet& propertySet,
         bool keysOnly,
         const MI_Filter* filter)
     {
         if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1001)
         {
             // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1001","Widget.Key=1003"
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1001);
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1003);
             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);
             context.Post(c);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else if (instanceName.Key_value() == 1002)
         {
             // Connector.Left="Gadget.Key=1002","Widget.Key=1004"
             Widget_Class w;
             w.Key_value(1002);
             Gadget_Class g;
             g.Key_value(1004);
             Connector_Class c;
             c.Left_value(w);
             c.Right_value(g);
             context.Post(c);
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_OK);
         }
         else
         {
             context.Post(MI_RESULT_NOT_FOUND);
         }
     }

8.3.8 Implementing indication operations (_experimental_)
---------------------------------------------------------

Please note that indications should only be posted from a separate
thread within the provider (a “background thread”).  They should not
be posted using the 'omiserver' thread during a call into a provider.
For example, during an 'EnumerateInstances' call, the provider should
directly post its instances and final result.  It should not directly
post indications within that function call.  Instead, it should post
indications on a separate background thread.  Violation of this policy
may trigger unexpected behavior in 'omiserver'.  The following examples
illustrate appropriate techniques for posting alert and lifecycle
indications.

8.3.8.1 Implementing an alert indication (_experimental_)
.........................................................

As an example, consider the following MOF schema:

     /* Indication class derived from the CIM standard indication class */
     class XYZ_DiskFault : CIM_Indication
     {
       string detailmessage;
     };

The generated code snippet looks like this:

     void MI_CALL XYZ_DiskFault_EnableIndications(
             XYZ_DiskFault_Self* self,
             MI_Context* indicationsContext,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className )

8.3.8.2 Implementing a lifecycle indication (_experimental_)
............................................................

This section describes how to implement lifecycle indication support in
a normal class.

Consider a common process class as an example:

     /* A class derived from CIM_Process */
     class XYZ_Process : CIM_Process
     {
       uint32 runningTime;

       [static]
       uint32 Create( [in] string imageName, [out] CIM_Process REF process );
       uint32 GetRunTime( [in] uint32 pid, [out] uint32 runningTime );
     };

The generated code snippet looks like this:

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_EnumerateInstances(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className,
             const MI_PropertySet* propertySet,
             MI_Boolean keysOnly,
             const MI_Filter* filter )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_GetInstance(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className,
             const XYZ_Process* instanceName,
             const MI_PropertySet* propertySet )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_CreateInstance(

     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_ModifyInstance(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,

             const MI_Char* className,
             const XYZ_Process* modifiedInstance,
             const MI_PropertySet* propertySet )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_DeleteInstance(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className,
             const XYZ_Process* instanceName )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_Invoke_RequestStateChange(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,

             const MI_Char* className,

             const XYZ_Process* instanceName,
             const XYZ_Process_RequestStateChange* in )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_Invoke_Create(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className,
             const MI_Char* methodName,
             const XYZ_Process* instanceName,
             const XYZ_Process_Create* in )
     {
       MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );
     }

     void MI_CALL XYZ_Process_Invoke_GetRunTime(
             XYZ_Process_Self* self,
             MI_Context* context,
             const MI_Char* nameSpace,
             const MI_Char* className,

             const XYZ_Process_GetRunTime* in )
     {
         MI_PostResult( context, MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED );

Implementation of lifecycle indications within this class takes a form

An alternative way to generate a lifecycle indication is to define an
indication class that derives from the lifecycle indication class.  For
example, consider the 'ABC_Process' class below.  'ABC_ProcessCreation'
is defined so as to generate a CIM_InstCreation indication for the
'ABC_Process' class:

     class ABC_Process : CIM_Process
     {
       uint32 runningTime;

       [static]
       uint32 Create( [in] string imageName, [out] CIM_Process REF process );
     };

     class ABC_ProcessCreation : CIM_InstCreation
     {
     };

8.3.8.3 More sample code for indications (_experimental_)
.........................................................

For more detailed examples of indication implementations, please see the
Indication subdirectory under the samples directory.

8.4 Building the provider
=========================

To build the provider with the generated 'GNUmakefile' just type 'make'.
This creates a shared library, containing the provider.  On Linux, this
file will be named 'libxyzconnector.so'.

8.5 Registering the provider
============================

To register the provider, use the 'omireg' tool, which creates a
registration file ('xyzconnector.reg') under the registration directory
and copies the provider to the 'lib' directory.  For example:

     $ omireg libxyzconnector.so
     Created /opt/omi/lib/libxyzconnector.so
     Created /opt/omi/etc/omiregister/root-cimv2/xyzconnector.reg

By default the provider is hosted in the same process as the server.  To
host the provider in a separate process see the '--hosting' option.

Also by default the provider services the 'root/cimv2' namespace.  To
change the namespace, see the '--namespace' option.

For more help with the 'omireg' tool, use the '-h' option.

The contents of the 'xyzconnector.reg' file are listed below.

     # omireg /home/someuser/connector/libxyzconnector.so
     HOSTING=@inproc@
     LIBRARY=xyzconnector
     CLASS=XYZ_Connector{XYZ_Widget,XYZ_Gadget}
     CLASS=XYZ_Gadget
     CLASS=XYZ_Widget

It is better to use 'omireg' to re-generate these files rather than
editing them directly.  If you do edit them, you should only need to
change the hosting model.  The supported hosting models include:

   * *@inproc@* - provider runs in same process as server.
   * *@requestor@* - provider runs in separate process as the
     requester's user (the client's authenticated user).
   * *USERNAME* - provider runs as this specified user.

8.6 Validating the provider
===========================

To validate the provider, use the 'omicli' tool to send requests to the
new providers.  The following command enumerates instances of the new
'Widget' provider.

     # omicli ei root/cimv2 XYZ_Widget

Appendix C Cross compiling OMI
******************************

C.1 Synopsis
============

This appendix explains how to build OMI with a cross compiler.  Two such
targets are supported today:

     MONTAVISTA_IX86_GNU
     NETBSD_IX86_GNU

Additional platforms can be supported by extending the 'buildtool'
script (following MONTAVISTA_IX86_GNU target as an example).

C.2 Terminology
===============

The "host" platform is where the compiler is run to build OMI. The
"target" platform is where the output binaries files will run.  These
can be the same, but in the case of cross-compiling they are different.
This appendix uses the term "target" to refer to the platform where the
binaries will be run.

C.3 Configuring
===============

By default, the 'configure' script guesses the platform based on the
host environment.  But with cross-compiling, the platform is given by
the -target option as shown below:

     ./configure --target=MONTAVISTA_IX86_GNU

Additional options are required to specify to location of the
cross-compiler components.  These include:

     --with-cc=PATH          Use C compiler given by PATH.
     --with-cxx=PATH         Use C++ compiler given by PATH.
     --with-ar=PATH          Use archive command (ar) given by PATH.
     --openssl=PATH          Full path to the "openssl" command.
     --opensslcflags=FLAGS   Extra C flags needed for OpenSSL.
                             (_e.g._ "-I/usr/local/include").
     --openssllibs=FLAGS     Extra library options needed for OpenSSL.
                             (_e.g._ "-L/usr/local/lib -lssl -lcrypto").
     --openssllibdir=PATH    The path of the directory containing the desired
                             OpenSSL libraries (ssl and crypto).

So to run configure, one might have something like this:

     ./configure
         --target=NETBSD_IX86_GNU
         --with-cc=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-gcc
         --with-cxx=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-g++
         --with-ar=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-ar
         --opensslcflags="-I /opt/toolchain/include"
         --openssllibdir=/opt/toolchain/lib64
         --openssllibs="-L/opt/toolchain/lib64 -lssl -lcrypto"

Of course this is only an example.  The exact location of these
components will vary.

C.4 Installing
==============

When cross-compiling, it is obviously no longer possible to simply type
"make install" to install the components (since the components must be
copied to another platform).  Instead, components may be installed into
an interim directory and then copied from there onto the target
platform.  The DESTDIR variable can be used for this purpose.  For
example, suppose that we configured like this:

     ./configure
         --target=NETBSD_IX86_GNU
         --prefix=/opt/omi
         --with-cc=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-gcc
         --with-cxx=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-g++
         --with-ar=/opt/toolchain/bin/586-ar
         --opensslcflags="-I /opt/toolchain/include"
         --openssllibdir=/opt/toolchain/lib64
         --openssllibs="-L/opt/toolchain/lib64 -lssl -lcrypto"

Next, the installable components can all be copied to an interim
directory called "/tmp/install" like this:

     make DESTDIR=/tmp/install install

Finally, the components can be copied from the /tmp/install directory to
the target machine.

Appendix D NITS Integrated Test System
**************************************

D.1 Introduction
================

This document defines a C unit test framework and instructions for its
use.  This framework is a replacement for existing unit test
infrastructure that makes debugging, maintenance, and code coverage
significantly easier.  The unit test framework encompasses several
related components:

   * libnits.so: Contains the framework implementation.  This binary
     contains shared memory spaces appropriate for test builds only.
     Product binaries must not link to 'libnits.so' on official builds.
   * libnitsinj.so: Injects the test framework and any other mocked
     function tables into relevant processes during unit test runs.  No
     one links to this binary directly.
   * libnitsstub.a: Contains no-op implementations of the NITS API for
     product binaries using HOOK_BUILD or DEBUG_BUILD linkage.
   * nits: Contains a command-line interface for running the framework
     on a set of tests.  Spawns child processes if necessary, runs test
     cases, and reports results.
   * Unit test shared libraries: Contains product unit test suites.  All
     test cases are declared within the .cpp files of these binaries.
     Links to libnits.so using TEST_BUILD linkage.
   * Product shared libraries and executables: Uses macros and either
     runtime instrumentation or conditional blocks of code to run under
     unit test passes.  Should use HOOK_BUILD or DEBUG_BUILD linkage.

D.2 Linkage
===========

There are five different possible ways to link to the NITS package, each
with its own consequences:

   * <default>: All test macros are no-ops and NitsCallSite is
     minimized.  It is not possible to hook anything at runtime.  This
     option is used in projects/binaries that do not understand NITS.
   * HOOK_BUILD: Test macros call NitsFT stubs in libnitsstub.a.
     NitsCallSite is functional but does not show file/line information.
     Use the -target option to hook selected binaries at runtime.  This
     option is for production shared libraries and executables.
   * DEBUG_BUILD: Same as HOOK_BUILD, but includes '__FILE__',
     '__LINE__', and '__FUNCTION__' information.  This option is
     intended for production shared libraries and executables running
     under a debug/checked build.
   * TEST_BUILD: Test macros call the NITS implementation by linking
     with 'libnits.so'.  This is for test shared libraries.
   * 
D.3 Project Setup
=================

This section describes the basic source tree configuration steps
required to access the NITS API. Once these steps are complete, product
and test binaries are ready to start using the framework.  The project
will need access to the following files from the framework: 'nits.h',
'libnits.so', 'libpal.a', 'libnitsstub.a', 'nitsstub.obj' and 'nits'.

The recommended, supported project configuration is as follows:

D.3.1 Product Binaries
----------------------

   * Ideally the product code should take the form of a shared library,
     and executable modules should only be thin wrappers over the shared
     library.
   * Define HOOK_BUILD in product binaries as part of the sources files
     (for checked builds, DEBUG_BUILD provides more file/line
     information, but it also bloats the binary).
   * Include '<nits/base/nits.h>' in product and test source files.
   * Link to 'libnitsstub.a' and 'libpal.a' from product binaries
     ('$(PALLIBS)' expands to these two libraries).
   * 
D.3.2 Unit Test Binaries
------------------------

   * Define TEST_BUILD in unit test binaries as part of the GNUmakefile.
   * Link to '$(UNITTESTLIBS)' from unit test binaries.
     '$(UNITTESTLIBS)' expands to everything needed to build the test
     library.
   * Include 'libnits.so', 'libnitsinj.so', and 'nits' when distributing
     unit test binaries to test environments.

D.3.3 Pitfalls/Notes
--------------------

   * There are drawbacks to using 'HOOK_BUILD' against executable
     modules (_i.e_.  the trap table technique for calling internal
     product APIs does not work).

D.3.4 Sample Project
--------------------

For canonical up-to-date working examples, see the sample product and
test code in the following directories:

   * There are examples of various linkage types under:
     'nits/linkageSample'.
   * There are many test examples under 'nits/sample'.
   * There is product code under 'nits/sampleproduct'.

D.4 Deployment
==============

The nits binaries are built only in the 'unittest' environment, _i.e._
when the '--dev' option is passed to the './configure' script during
configuration and build.  the 'nits' executable is created inside the
'<output>/bin/' directory (where "'<output>'" is the directory where
output from the OMI build is saved.  The 'libnits.so', 'libnitsstub.a',
and 'libnitsinj.so' are all present in the '<output>/lib' directory and
can be used directly from there.

In order to run tests in all directories or in a single test directory,
you can run:

     make tests

This in turn invokes 'nits' with appropriate command-line arguments and
runs the single test or all test binaries.

The file '<output>/tmp/nitsargs.txt' contains the command-line arguments
passed to nits during the test run, if you use the '-file:' option
passed to nits to include it.

D.5 How to Call Product APIs
============================

NITS provides facilities to allow private APIs to be callable at will
without individually exporting all of them.  This makes it convenient to
link test shared libraries directly against product shared libraries,
which in turn allows simple and reliable code coverage measurements.
The alternative is linking the test code to product static libraries,
which leads to product code existing in many binaries at once.  While
this is not technically broken, it is impossible to retrieve accurate
coverage data in complex cases, and this has some tendency to encourage
duplication of product code in multiple product binaries.

D.5.1 Public APIs
-----------------

Public interfaces must be exported somehow.  This may be done
individually for each API, or function tables may be used (as in 'mi.h')
to export an entire collection of APIs from one binary using a single
export macro like 'MI_EXPORT'.  The latter technique leads to smaller
binary size but requires more care to avoid introducing breaking changes
to the contents of the table.

D.5.2 Private APIs
------------------

Non-public interfaces do not need to be exported in the same way.  The
recommended approach is to place all of the externally callable private
APIs from a given product binary into a single 'NitsTrapTable', and then
import that table into all the binaries that call any of the APIs.
Macros can be used to hide this behavior from the calling binaries.  A
simple example is available in 'nits/sample/test.cpp'.

D.6 How to Mock Product APIs
============================

NITS supports mocking private APIs that are already exposed through a
function table using the 'NitsSetTrap' API. The only additional change
needed in the product is that all mockable calls in the product must
invoke through the trap table, rather than directly calling the
function.  When NitsSetTrap is called, the function pointer in the table
is replaced and all calls through the pointer are redirected to the
mock.  For a simplified proof of concept, see 'AutitTest' in
'nits/sample/test.spp'.

D.7 Command Line Interface
==========================

The usage pattern for NITS is the following: 'nits [option|test]*'.  The
rest of this section describes the available options and test types,
along with the possible results for each test.

D.7.1 Options
-------------

   * -bpassert: Issues a breakpoint any time an assertion fails when it
     should not.  This is useful for debugging when it takes many steps
     to walk through the code to the point where the assertion fails.
   * -bpfault:number: Issues a breakpoint on a specific fault injection
     iteration number.  This option may be used multiple times.
   * -file:name: Appends the contents of name to the command line
     options.
   * -filter:binary[;binary...]: Prevents the injector from targeting
     processes containing none of the binaries in the filter list.
   * -install: Immediately installs the injector ('libnitsinj.so') to
     run in all relevant processes created after this point (including
     upon future boots).
   * -mode:Skip: Explores the test tree and skips all body fixtures.
   * -mode:Enable: (default) Runs test cases without fault injection.
   * -mode:IterativeFault: Runs test cases with Nth site single faults.
     This option is exhaustive for deterministic tests, but very slow.
   * -mode:StackFault: Optimized single fault injection; ignores
     duplicates based on call stack frames.
   * -pause: Waits for user input after running.  Useful for holding
     settings like 'target' and 'trace' when doing manual testing.
   * -reset: Ignores a test run in progress and forcibly resets the
     shared memory state.  Use this to recover from shared memory
     corruption.
   * -target:binary[;binary...]: Enables the injector on specific
     binaries in any process.
   * -trace:FailedTests: Shows failed tests only.  Least verbose result
     output.
   * -trace:WarnedTests: Shows failed and warned tests only.
   * -trace:AllTests: Shows all test cases.
   * -trace:Asserts: (default) Shows failed asserts individually.
   * -trace:Warnings: Shows failed asserts and warnings individually.
   * -trace:Iterations: Shows fault injection iteration information and
     asserts/warnings.
   * -trace:Verbose: Shows all of the above plus NitsTrace calls.
   * -uninstall: Removes 'libnitsinj.so' injection from all processes.
     Use this before updating NITS binaries.
   * -wtt:file: Logs WTT results to a WTT log file (requires WTT to be
     installed).
   * -match:testFixtureNameSubstring: Runs tests only if they contain
     fixture names matching the pattern (semicolon or comma-separated).
   * +name:value: Sets test parameter "name" to "value".  Test module
     can retrieve the value of the parameter by using the API
     NitsTestGetParam by passing the parameter name.
   * -fault: This option is used for fault injection.

D.7.2 Tests
-----------

Tests may be run using any of the following syntax forms:

   * libmodule.so: Specifying a file name runs all tests discovered
     during the loading of that library.  NITS now accepts relative and
     absolute paths.
   * libmodule.so:test: Specify the module name and a test name,
     separated by a bang, to run a particular test.  This runs all test
     variations.
   * libmodule.so:+test: Runs all tests in the module starting with the
     specified test.
   * libmodule.so:test/variation: Specify the module name, the test
     name, and a set of variation choices to run one specific test
     variation.  Each valid variation name is constructed from the set
     of choices made according to the hierarchy declared in the test
     code.
   * libmodule.so:*testnameSubstring: Runs all tests whose names contain
     the pattern.

The simplest way to discover a list of valid test names and variations
for a particular module is to run the entire module with the
'-mode:Skip' option.

Note: To run the NITS sample tests, use 'nits' as follows:

     ./output/bin/nits -install -reset -trace \
        -target:libnitssample.so,libnitssampleproduct.so \
        ./output/lib/libnitssample.so

D.7.3 Results
-------------

Each test variation reports a result to the test framework.  These
results are printed and then summarized.  The possible test results are
as follows:

   * Faulted: The test passed, and was then run successfully under
     automatic fault simulation.  There were no unexpected successes or
     failures during the fault simulation loop.
   * Passed: The test passed, and automatic fault simulation was not
     run.
   * Skipped: The test was disabled by the command line or the test
     setup code, and the test body was not run.  However, no errors were
     encountered during setup or cleanup.
   * Omitted: The test declared itself to be irrelevant.  These can be
     safely ignored.
   * Killed: When using the (old) isolate option, a test case was
     terminated after running for too long without reporting a result.
   * Failed: Assertions failed during the test body, or there were
     unexpected successes or failures during automatic fault simulation.
   * Error: Assertions failed during test setup or cleanup, or no
     assertions were attempted during the test body.

D.8 Implementation
==================

This section describes how to create basic unit tests under the NITS
framework.  This section shows only the most basic examples, using as
few features as possible.  See the following section for additional
examples for advanced features.  To run a test DLL containing a simple,
"hello world" unit test, see the following example:

     #include <nits/base/nits.h>

     NitsTest(Test1)
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("Test Body!"));
       NitsAssert(1 == 1, PAL_T("assert test!"));
       NitsCompare(1, 1, PAL_T("compare test!"));
       NitsCompareString(PAL_T("A"), PAL_T("A"), PAL_T("string test!"));
       NitsCompareSubstring(PAL_T("ABC"),PAL_T("B"),PAL_T("substring test!"));
     NitsEndTest

The code above contains a simple test body with some basic assertions
and traces.  Note that the assertion descriptions must be Unicode, but
some other arguments may be either ANSI or Unicode.  Inserting this code
into 'hello.dll' and compiling it produces a binary which can be run
using the following command:

     ./output/bin/nits ./output/lib/libhello.so

             [Passed]  ./output/lib/libhello.so:Test1


     Summary:
             Faulted:        0
             Passed:         1
             Skipped:        0
             Killed:         0
             Failed:         0
             Error:          0

             Successes:      1
             Failures:       0
             Total:          1

This listing shows that the test named 'Test1' in 'libhello.so' was run
successfully.  The test passed because the body ran one or more test
assertions, all of which succeeded.

D.9 A Selection of More Advanced Features
=========================================

This section contains a partial list of available NITS features, roughly
in order of increasing complexity.  Each feature can be used
independently of the others unless otherwise specified.

D.9.1 Tracing
-------------

The API 'NitsTrace' is available for tracing messages using the current
source location as the call site.  These messages will appear in
'stderr' only if tracing is enabled.

D.9.2 Assertions
----------------

The 'NitsAssert', 'NitsCompare', 'NitsCompareString', and
'NitsCompareSubstring' APIs validate results obtained during the test.
These functions return true if successful, but otherwise they are
printed to 'stderr' if assertions are enabled.

D.9.3 Call Sites
----------------

NITS defines a 'NitsCallSite' class which is available on all linkages,
though on some linkages it becomes trivialized.  This class contains a
source file, line, function name, and call site ID to be used for fault
injection and source location identification.  The APIs above use the
current source line (returned by the 'NitsHere( )' macro) as the
'NitsCallSite'.  However, this is not appropriate in common helper
functions where it is actually the caller"s location that is relevant.
The following example shows how to carry a 'CallSite' through to a
helper function:

     void TestHelper( NitsCallSite cs )
     {
       //Prints location of NitsHere( ) below.
       NitsTraceEx( L"Helper function!", cs, NitsAutomatic );
     }

     NitsTest(Test1)
         TestHelper(NitsHere());
     NitsEndTest

The macros 'NitsTraceEx', 'NitsAssertEx', 'NitsCompareEx',
'NitsCompareStringEx', and 'NitsCompareSubstringEx' are available for
this purpose, each taking the same argument list as their counterparts,
plus a call site argument.  'NitsCallSite' objects may be created easily
using either the 'NitsHere( )' or 'NitsNamedCallSite' macros.  For
manual fault simulation, use 'NitsNamedCallSite(id)', where the site ID
is defined by the application.  Otherwise, 'NitsHere( )', which is
anonymous, generally suffices.

D.9.4 Fixtures
--------------

NITS tests are made from one or more Fixtures.  Fixtures are reusable
units of test code.  They support composability; _i.e._  they can be
composed out of other fixtures.  They also allow you to share data
between each other by letting you associate a type(a C 'struct') with
them and providing an initialization value for that type.  There are
various types of fixtures:

   * Setup
   * Split
   * Test
   * Cleanup
   * ModuleSetup

These types of fixtures are described in the following sections, along
with an illustration of how you can share data between fixtures using an
auto-created abstraction called a 'NitsContext( )'.

D.9.5 Setup Fixtures
--------------------

D.9.5.1 Basic Setup Fixtures
............................

The most basic setup fixture involves bracketing some test code between
'NitsSetup(<fixtureName>)' and 'NitsEndSetup' macros.  Here is an
example of such a fixture:

     NitsSetup(SimpleSetup)
             NitsTrace(PAL_T("SimpleSetup being run"));
     NitsEndSetup

   * 'SimpleSetup' is the name of the fixture.
   * 'NitsSetup' and 'NitsEndSetup' form the start and end of the Setup
     fixture.
   * The part in between represents the body of the Setup fixture that
     is run during the test run.

Note: 'NitsEndSetup' and similar end macros are part of every fixture,
and they help NITS provide a function continuation style of usage, in
which all the fixtures from which your test is composed are on the same
stack.  This lets you use local variables throughout the entire lifetime
of the test.

D.9.5.2 Associating a Data Type with a Setup Fixture
....................................................

To associate a data type with a Setup fixture, you need to define a C
'struct' as the data type, and write test code between the 'NitsSetup0(
<fixtureName>, <name of the data type> )' and 'NitsEndSetup' macros.
Below is an example that shows how to associate a type with a Setup
fixture:

     struct MyStruct
     {
         int x;
     };
     NitsSetup0( Fixture0, MyStruct )
         NitsContext( )->_MyStruct->x = 0;
     NitsEndSetup

   * 'Fixture0' is the name of the fixture.
   * 'NitsSetup0' and 'NitsEndSetup' start and end the Setup fixture.
     The numeral '0' indicates that it is composed of zero other
     fixtures.  As explained below, 'NitsSetup<N' is used to define
     Setup fixtures composed of 'N' other fixtures.
   * 'MyStruct' defines a C 'struct' that is then associated with
     'Fixture0' as its data type.
   * Once you associate a data type with a Setup fixture, NITS
     auto-creates an object of the type specified by 'MyStruct' and
     makes it available within the 'NitsContext( )' abstraction.
   * The 'NitsContext( )' will have an auto-created variable with a name
     composed of an underscore followed by the data-type name (_e.g._
     in this example '_MyStruct').  This variable is a pointer to the
     auto-created data object, and can be used for data sharing between
     fixtures.
   * As seen in the example below, '(NitsContext()->_MyStruct->x)' lets
     you access the 'int x' from the auto-created object of type
     'MyStruct' that is pointed to by the variable '_MyStruct' within
     'NitsContext( )'.

D.9.5.3 Setup Fixture Composition
.................................

The syntax for composing a Setup fixture with 1 other child fixture wold
begin with the start macro:

     NitsSetup1( <fixtureName>,
                 <name of fixture data Type>,
                 <name of child fixture 1>,
                 <initialization value for child fixture 1> )

The test code would follow, and be ended by the 'NitsEndSetup' macro.

Below is an example of how to compose a fixture from one other child
fixture while also associating a data type with each fixture so that you
can pass data back and forth in either direction:

     struct FooStruct1
     {
       int i1;
     };

     struct FooStruct2
     {
       int i2;
     };

     NitsSetup0( FooSetup1, FooStruct1 )
       NitsAssert(NitsContext()->_FooStruct1->i1 == 10,
                  PAL_T("wrong value"));
       NitsContext()->_FooStruct1->i1 = 15;
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("FooSetup1 being run"));
     NitsEndSetup

     struct FooStruct1 sFooStruct1 = {10};

     NitsSetup1( FooSetup2, FooStruct2, FooSetup1, sFooStruct1 )
       NitsAssert(NitsContext()->_FooSetup1->_FooStruct1->i1 == 15,
                  PAL_T("wrong value"));
       NitsContext()->_FooSetup1->_FooStruct1->i1 = 35;
       NitsContext()->_FooStruct2->i2 = 25;
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("FooSetup2 being run"));
     NitsEndSetup

   * Here 'FooSetup1' and 'FooSetup2' are the names of the two Setup
     fixtures.
   * 'FooSetup1' uses the 'NitsSetup0/NitsEndSetup' syntax, since it is
     not composed of any other fixtures.
   * 'FooSetup2' is composed of one child fixture, 'FooSetup1', and
     hence uses the 'NitsSetup1/NitsEndSetup' syntax.
   * The C 'struct FooStruct1' is the data type associated with
     'FooSetup1'.
   * The C 'struct FooStruct2' is the data type associated with
     'FooSetup2'.
   * When composing from one child fixture in 'NitsSetup1', the macro
     parameters are 'FooSetup2, FooStruct2, FooSetup1, sFooStruct1',
     which represent:

        - The name of the fixture.
        - The data type associated with the fixture.
        - The name of the child fixture.
        - The initialization value for the fixture.

   * The initialization value 'sFooStruct1' given to fixture 'FooSetup1'
     is automatically populated into the data object pointed to by
     'NitsContext( )->_FooStruct' when the fixture 'FooSetup1' runs.
     Note that the initialization object is used as copy-by-value and it
     is copied into the data object pointed to by 'NitsContext( )' of
     the fixture that it is initializing.  That is why 'FooSetup1' in
     the above example can assert that the value of
     'NitsContext()->_FooStruct1->i1' will be 10 when it runs.
   * The initialization value for a fixture has to be a
     compile-time-defined global variable of the data type associated
     with the fixture.  Alternately, to pass an all-zero initialization
     value, you can use the NITS-auto-created global variable named
     '<name of fixture>Defaults' (_e.g._  in this example, if the
     'FooSetup2' fixture wanted to specify an all-zero initialization
     value for 'FooSetup1' then it could have used the auto-created
     object named 'FooSetup1Defaults'.
   * When a fixture is composed of other child fixtures, the
     auto-created 'NitsContext( )' abstraction inside the fixture
     contains appropriate pointers to access the data from all the child
     fixtures it is composed of.  The name of the variable inside
     'NitsContext( )' that points to the context of the child fixture
     takes the form, '_<child fixture name>'.
   * In this example, 'NitsContext( )' inside 'FooSetup2' has the
     following variables:

        - '_FooStruct2', which is a pointer to the data object of type
          'FooStruct2' auto-created for itself, since the data type
          associated with 'FooSetup2' is 'FooStruct2'.
        - '_FooSetup1', which is a pointer to the 'NitsContext( )'
          inside the child fixture 'FooSetup1'.
        - '_FooSetup1' then contains the pointer '_FooStruct1', which is
          a pointer to the data object associated with the child fixture
          'FooSetup1', since the data type associated with '_FooSetup1'
          is 'FooStruct1'.

   * Thus, as seen in the above example, there is data sharing in both
     directions between a fixture and all child fixtures it is composed
     of.  This is critical when you want to parameterize fixtures and
     reuse the same test code written in the Setup fixtures with
     different data values:

        - 'FooSetup2' can pass an initialization value to 'FooSetup1',
          which it can see when it is run.
        - 'FooSetup1' can modify the values inside the 'NitsContext( )'
          associated with it.
        - 'FooSetup2', which will run after 'FooSetup1', can then read
          the values modified by 'FooSetup1' inside 'NitsContext( )'.

   * The macros, 'NitsSetup2', 'NitsSetup3', 'NitsSetup4', and
     'NitsSetup5' let you define Setup fixtures composed of 2, 3, 4, or
     5 child fixtures.  They use similar syntax:

          NitsSetup<2/3/4/5>( <fixtureName>,
                              <dataTypeOfFixture>,
                              <child fixture1,
                                <initialization value of child fixture1>,
                              <child fixture2>,
                                <initialization value of child fixture2>,
                              <child fixture3>,
                                <initialization value of child fixture3>,
                              <child fixture4>,
                                <initialization value of child fixture4>,
                              <child fixture5>,
                                <initialization value of child fixture5> )

   * Note that when a specific Setup fixture runs, all child Setup
     fixtures that it is composed of will be run in left to right order
     of their definition before the fixture itself runs.  All of them
     will run on the same stack, one above the other, and as a result,
     you can pass pointers to local variables around within
     'NitsContext( )'.  All local variables in child fixtures are still
     available when the parent fixture runs.  The stack trace below
     shows how the stack might look like when running the fixtures
     above:

          (gdb) bt
          #0  FooSetup2 (_NitsContext=0x60e990)
                 at NitsNewInterfaceTests.cpp:489
          #3  0x00007ffff76c4e3b in FooSetup1 (_NitsContext=0x60e950)
                 at NitsNewInterfaceTests.cpp:485
          #13 0x0000000000400dd2 in main (argc=6, argv=0x7fffffffe558) at nits.cpp:146

   * If you do not want to associate a data type with a specific Setup
     fixture, you can use the NITS-defined empty data type
     'NitsEmptyStruct' as the data type and the NITS-defined
     initialization value 'NitsEmptyValue' to initialize the empty data
     type fixture.

D.9.5.4 How to Re-use Setup Fixtures in Multiple Files
......................................................

The 'NitsDeclSetup<N>/NitsDefSetup<N>' macros allow you declare fixtures
in a '.h' file and define them in '.cpp' files.  This lets you reuse the
same Setup fixture in multiple files.

Here is an example:

     Foo.h =>

     struct MyStruct
     {
         int x;
     };

     NitsDeclSetup0(Fixture0, MyStruct);

     Foo.cpp =>

     NitsDefSetup0(Fixture0, MyStruct)
         NitsContext()->_MyStruct->x = 0;
     NitsEndSetup

   * In the above example, 'Fixture0' is declared with data type
     'MyStruct' in 'Foo.h'.
   * 'Fixture0' is defined in 'Foo.cpp'.
   * Note that 'Fixture0' can be used in other '.cpp' files to construct
     other Setup/Split/Test fixtures.

D.9.6 Split Fixtures
--------------------

Using Split fixtures, you can split the execution of tests into two or
more tests.  This lets you execute the same test code in multiple
configurations.  A Split fixture that splits a test into two child
fixtures starts with a 'NitsSplit2' macro having the following syntax:

     NitsSplit2( <fixtureName>,
                 <data type of fixture>,
                 <name of child fixture 1>,
                 <name of child fixture 2> )

Place the test code after this macro, and end it with the 'NitsEndSplit'
macro.

Below is an example of a Split fixture composed of two child fixtures
that define two child configurations in which the test will run:

     struct MyContext
     {
         int a;
     };

     NitsSetup0(MySetup1, MyContext)
         NitsContext()->_MyContext->a = 4;
     NitsEndSetup

     NitsSetup0(MySetup2, MyContext)
         NitsContext()->_MyContext->a = 8;
     NitsEndSetup

     NitsSplit2(MySplitSetup, MyContext, MySetup1, MySetup2)
         NitsAssert((NitsContext()->_MyContext->a == 4) || (NitsContext()-
     >_MyContext->a == 8), PAL_T("value is wrong"));
     NitsEndSplit

   * Here 'MySetup1' and 'MySetup2' are two Setup fixtures that have
     data type 'MyContext'.
   * Each of them assigns a value of 4 or 8 to the variable 'a' inside
     the 'NitsContext' data object.
   * The 'NitsSplit2/NitsEndSplit' macros provide syntax for defining a
     Split fixture.  'MySplitSetup' is a Split fixture that lets you
     split the test into two Setup fixtures 'MySetup1' and 'MySetup2'.
   * NITS automatically runs the test in the 'MySplitSetup' fixture in
     two configurations, once with 'MySetup1' and next with 'MySetup2'.
   * Note that the Split fixture must have the same data type as the two
     or more child fixtures it is composed of.  In this example, that
     data type is the C 'struct MyContext'.
   * Note that the split fixture syntax doesn't allow you to pass an
     initialization value to the child fixtures.  This is because the
     initialization value in the child fixtures will be the same as the
     initialization value that the split fixture gets from the parent
     fixture.
   * NITS makes sure that the 'NitsContext( )->_MyContext' inside the
     split fixture 'MySplitSetup' automatically points to the correct
     child fixture's context ('MySetup1' or 'MySetup2''s context) when
     the test is run.  This allows you to assert that the value of
     'NitsContext( )->_MyContext->a' will be either 4 or 8 when running
     'MySplitSetup' since the child fixtures 'MySetup1/MySetup2' set it
     up that way by updating it to 4 and 8 respectively.
   * The 'NitsSplit3', 'NitsSplit4', and 'NitsSplit5' macros let you
     define split fixtures which will split into 3, 4, and 5 other child
     fixtures and follow a similar syntax:

          NitsSplit<3 or 4 or 5>( <fixtureName>,
                                  <data type of fixture>,
                                  <name of child fixture 1>,
                                  <name of child fixture 2>,
                                  <name of child fixture 3>,
                                  <name of child fixture 4>,
                                  <name of child fixture 5> )

   * Similar to Setup fixtures, you can also separate the declaration
     and definition of Split fixtures by using the
     'NitsDeclSplit<N>/NitsDefSplit<N>' macros.
   * Some common usage scenarios for Split Fixtures are:

        - You have a client server test which you need to run with the
          server started in different configurations (_e.g._  hosted in
          a Windows service or in the test process itself, or in IIS).
        - You have some test that you need to run over multiple Auth
          modes or different character sets, or over different protocols
          like HTTP, HTTPs, and so on.

D.9.7 Test Fixtures
-------------------

Test is just one other kind of fixture in NITS. The implementation
section above already defined 'NitsTest/NitsEndTest' syntax for basic
tests in NITS. This section describes syntax for more advanced tests
that are composed of one or more other 'Setup' or 'Split' fixtures.  A
Test fixture composed of one child fixture starts with a 'NitsTest1'
macro having the following syntax:

     NitsTest1( <testFixtureName>,
                <child fixture 1>,
                <initializer for child fixture 1> )

Test code follows, and the fixture is ends with the 'NitsEndTest' macro.
Here is an example:

     struct FooStruct1
     {
       int i1;
     };

     NitsSetup0(FooSetup1, FooStruct1)
       NitsAssert(NitsContext()->_FooStruct1->i1 == 20, PAL_T("wrong value"));
       NitsContext()->_FooStruct1->i1 = 35;
     NitsEndSetup

     struct FooStruct1 sFooStruct1 = {20};

     NitsTest1(FooTest, FooSetup1, sFooStruct1)
         NitsAssert( NitsContext()->_FooSetup1->_FooStruct1->i1 == 35,
                     PAL_T("wrong value"));
     NitsEndTest

   * In the above example, 'FooSetup1' is a setup fixture with data type
     'FooStruct1'.
   * The 'NitsTest1/NitsEndTest' macro pair determine the syntax for
     defining a test composed out of one child fixture.
   * 'FooTest' is the name of the test, which is composed of 'FooSetup1'
     and passes 'sFooStruct1' as the initialization value to
     'FooSetup1'.
   * When the test is run, 'FooSetup1' runs first, followed by 'FooTest'
     on the same stack, as mentioned earlier.
   * 'NitsContext( )' inside the test body also follows a format similar
     to that of a Setup fixtures, in that it has auto-created variables
     of the format '_<Child fixture name>' that point to 'NitsContext(
     )' data objects inside the child fixture.
   * Note that there is no data type associated with a Test fixture; its
     'NitsContext( )' only lets you access the 'NitsContext( )' data
     objects inside child fixtures.
   * In above example, when 'FooSetup1' runs, the value of variable 'i1'
     inside the 'NitsContext( )->_FooStruct1' data object is 20, since
     the test passes initializer 'sFooStruct1' which sets it to 20.
   * 'FooSetup1' itself then updates 'i1' to 35.
   * Therefore, when the test body runs, the value of 'i1' is 35.  This
     illustrates data sharing between a Test fixture and its children in
     both directions.
   * The 'NitsTest2', 'NitsTest3', 'NitsTest4', and 'NitsTest5' macros
     let you define tests composed of 2, 3, 4, and 5 Setup/Split child
     fixtures.  Child fixtures are run in the left-to-right direction in
     which they are defined.  These macros use a syntax like the
     following:

          NitsTest<2 or 3 or 4 or 5>( <testfixtureName>,
                                      <child fixture 1>,
                                      <initializer for child fixture 1>,
                                      <child fixture 2>,
                                      <initializer for child fixture 2>,
                                      <child fixture 3>,
                                      <initializer for child fixture 3>,
                                      <child fixture 4>,
                                      <initializer for child fixture 4>,
                                      <child fixture 5>,
                                      <initializer for child fixture 5> )

   * The 'NitsTestWithSetup' macro lets you define a simple test fixture
     composed of a child Setup fixture defined using 'NitsSetup'.
     'NitsTestWithInitializableSetup' lets you define a test composed of
     one Setup fixture taking initialization data.  For all the 'Nits*'
     macro definitions, see the 'nits.h' header file in the
     'admin/wmi/winomi/nits/base/' directory.
   * Note that the interface lets you construct arbitrary directed
     acyclic graphs (DAGs) of Test fixtures.  It is possible that the
     same Setup/Split fixture can appear multiple times in such a graph
     without causing any problem, because NITS instantiates and runs a
     fixture only once.  As a result, you can be sure of not having
     multiple executions of the same fixture or having multiple copies
     of its 'NitsContext( )' object.

D.9.8 Cleanup Fixtures
----------------------

Cleanup fixture can be defined on any of the above type of fixtures
(_i.e._  on Setup, Split, Test, or ModuleSetup fixtures).  The Cleanup
fixture is run at the end of the test body for Setup, Split, and Test
fixtures, and at the end of the test module for ModuleSetup fixtures.
Because a Cleanup fixture has access to the same 'NitsContext( )' as the
fixture for which it is cleaning up, you can use it to clean up anything
you need to.

A Cleanup fixture begins with a 'NitsCleanup' macro that uses the
following syntax:

     NitsCleanup( <fixtureName for which the Cleanup fixture is defined> )

The code for the body of the test follows this start macro, and
'NitsEndCleanup'.  Here is an example:

     NitsSetup(MySetup1)
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("MySetup1 being run"));
     NitsEndSetup

     NitsCleanup(MySetup1)
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("Cleanup for MySetup1 being run"));
     NitsEndCleanup

   * Here the Cleanup is defined on a Setup fixture, 'MySetup1'.
   * The syntax starts with the 'NitsCleanup' macro, and ends with the
     'NitsEndCleanup' macro.
   * The name of the Cleanup fixture is same as the fixture for which it
     is defined.
   * In a test hierarchy, each fixture could have a Cleanup fixture
     defined.  In that case the Cleanup fixtures are run in the reverse
     order in which the fixtures themselves are executed (_e.g._
     'Setup1=>Test1=>Cleanup(Test1)=>Cleanup(Setup1)'.

D.9.9 ModuleSetup Fixtures
--------------------------

ModuleSetup fixtures let you define test code that is run at the
beginning and end of the test module.  This is useful in places where
you want to run some piece of test code only once per test module at the
beginning and end of it.

Here is an example:

     NitsModuleSetup(MyModuleSetup1)
         NitsTrace(PAL_T("MyModuleSetup1 being run"));
         NitsAssert(PAL_TRUE, PAL_T(""));
     NitsEndModuleSetup

     NitsCleanup(MyModuleSetup1)
         NitsTrace(PAL_T("Cleanup for MyModuleSetup1 being run"));
     NitsEndCleanup

   * 'MyModuleSetup1' defines a ModuleSetup fixture that will be run at
     the beginning of the module in which it is located.
   * As with all other fixtures, you can define Cleanup fixtures also on
     ModuleSetup fixtures.  They will be run at the end of the module.
   * You can have multiple ModuleSetup fixtures in a test
     module(DLL/shared object library) and all of them will be run
     sequentially at the beginning of the module.
   * In the case of test isolation mode, _i.e._  running tests in their
     own processes, the ModuleSetup is run per test process.
   * Currently, this feature has limited capabilities.  For example, it
     doesn't let you pass data around or compose ModuleSetup fixtures
     out of other fixtures.  There are plans to add more functionality
     in the future.

D.9.10 A Note about C++ Tests
-----------------------------

In the case where functions to be tested are inside a class written in
C++, you need to write C wrappers for those functions.  In 'class1':

     class class1
     {
       int foo1();
     };

The corresponding NITSs C++ file containing traps should look something
like this:

     PAL_BEGIN_EXTERNC
     	int class1_foo1()
     	{
     		class1* obj = construct_class1();
     		return obj->foo1();
     	}
     	class1* construct_class1()
     	{
     		return new class1();
     	}
     PAL_END_EXTERNC

     NitsTrapValue(class1Traps)
     	class1_foo
     NitsEndTrapValue

The corresponding NITS traps header file should look something like
this:

     NitsTrapTable(class1Traps,0)
            int (NITS_CALL* _class1_foo)();
     NitsEndTrapTable

     NitsTrapExport(class1Traps)

A NITS test for the above product class might look like the following
(assuming that the product binary is named 'libfoo.so'):

     struct Ptr
     {
       void* ptr;
     };

     Ptr PtrVal = {NULL};

     NitsSetup0(MyModuleSetup1, Ptr)
       NitsTrapHandle h = NitsOpenTrap("libfoo.so", class1Traps);
       NitsAssert(h != NULL, PAL_T("Failed to load cla11Traps"));
       NitsContext()->_Ptr->ptr = h;

       // Optionally, you could call a helper function too:
       CallHelperFunction()
     NitsEndSetup

     NitsCleanup(MyModuleSetup1)
     	NitsTrapHandle h = NitsContext()->_Ptr-ptr;
     	if(h != NULL)
     		NitsCloseTrap(h);
     NitsEndCleanup

     NitsTest(MyModuleSetup1, PtrVal)
        NitsTrapHandle h = NitsContext()->_op1->_Ptr->ptr;
        int result = NitsGetTrap(h, class1Traps, _class1_foo)();
        NitsAssert(result != 1, PAL_T("Test failed"));
     NitsEndTest

D.9.11 Automatic Fault Simulation
---------------------------------

NITS provides automatic fault simulation functionality, which works as
follows:

   * The user annotates the places where the Faults should be simulated
     by using calls to 'NitsShouldFault'.
   * When NITS tests are run with fault simulation enabled (either by
     using the '-fault' switch or by using 'NitsEnableFaultSim' inside
     the test body), the test body is run multiple times.
   * In the first run, no faults are simulated (_i.e._  all calls to
     'NitsShouldFault' return FALSE).
   * The test body is then run in a loop multiple times, and in each
     iteration, one specific 'NitsShouldFault' call returns TRUE.
   * The user can simulate failure behavior by failing the specific
     external API or internal function when the corresponding
     'NitsShouldFault' call returns TRUE.
   * Below is an example of a function using this functionality.
   * By default, only the test body is only run in a loop.  However, if
     the test body uses the macro 'NitsFaultSimMarkForRerun', the entire
     test hierarchy is run in a loop.  That helps in scenarios where the
     Setup/Cleanup fixtures need to be executed in every fault
     simulation iteration.
   * Before running the tests in fault simulation mode, run 'nits
     -install'.  This sets up a file that indicates to 'libnitsstub.a'
     that it should load 'libnitsinj.so', which patches the stubbed
     version of the NITS API table in product and test binaries with the
     actual NITS implementation.
   * All binaries that are linked with NITS using HOOK_BUILD should be
     specified using the '-target' switch if they need to be
     fault-simulated.
   * OMI tests already use this functionality for all test binaries.

     int Foo()
     {
       if(NitsShouldFault(NitsHere(), NitsAutomatic))
       {
         // Simulate failure path behavior
         // failure return
         return -1;
       }
       // continue with implementation

       // success return
       return 0;
     }

D.10 Enabling Logging during Unit Testing with NITS
===================================================

On the NITS command line, use the '+loglevel:<value>' option to set the
level of logging detail ('loglevel') to one of the following values,
which are NOT case-sensitive:

       0
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       FATAL
       ERR
       WARNING
       INFO
       DEBUG
       VERBOSE

For example:

     nits +loglevel:5 test_base.dll
     output/bin/nits +loglevel:verbose output/lib/libtest_miapi.so

The resulting log files are saved in the '<topleveldir>/output/var/log/'
directory as follows:

   * Logs from 'omiserver' appear in 'omiserver.log'.  Individual unit
     tests start the server when required, and the 'loglevel' passed in
     is the same as the test process"s current 'loglevel'.
   * Logs from 'omiagent' appear in 'omiagent*.log'.
   * Logs from tests involving the client stack (using the MI API)
     appear in 'miclient.log'.
   * For tests that do not involve the client stack in the test process
     (_i.e._  everything other than 'test_cli' and 'test_miapi'), the
     test process prints its logs to 'omitest.log'.
   * If you want to see output of test process in the console itself,
     you can use the '+logstderr:1' option on the NITS command line.
     For example:

          output/bin/nits +loglevel:verbose +logstderr:1 \
                          output/lib/libtest_base.so

     Remember, however, that this works only for tests that do not use
     the MI API (_i.e._  everything other than test_cli and test_miapi).
     MI-API code closes the log every time the test closes the MI
     application.  As a result, even if the test library tried to set
     the log to 'stderr' so as to print to the console, output would be
     routed to the 'miclient.log' every time the MI application closes
     and re-opens.

Note: Because '+loglevel:<value>' and '+logstderr:1' are not built-in
NITS command-line options, they are not included in NITS usage help.
They are implemented through the NITS module setup/cleanup constructs
that let us run code at the beginning and end of a test module run.  In
this way, we use a common Setup/Cleanup fixture defined inside the 'ut\'
directory to set the loglevels and route the log data to 'stderr' at the
beginning of the module level setup, and to close the log during the
module level cleanup.

Below is an example of using 'NitsModuleSetup/NitsCleanup' from
'ut\omitestcommon.cpp'.  You can have multiple module-level setups and
cleanups in a module.  All Module setups will be run at the beginning of
the test module and all cleanups at the end after running all tests
within the module.

     NitsModuleSetup(OMITestSetup)
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("OMITestSetup being run"));
       if(NitsTestGetParam(PAL_T("logstderr")))
       {
         Log_OpenStdErr();
       }
       else
       {
         PAL_Char finalPath[PAL_MAX_PATH_SIZE];
         /* Create name and Open the log file */
         if((CreateLogFileNameWithPrefix("omitest", finalPath) != 0) ||
           (Log_Open(finalPath) != MI_RESULT_OK))
         {
           NitsTrace(
             PAL_T("failed to open log file; routing output to stderr"));
           Log_OpenStdErr();
         }
       }
       const PAL_Char *loglevelParam = NitsTestGetParam(PAL_T("loglevel"));
       if(loglevelParam && Log_SetLevelFromPalCharString(loglevelParam) != 0)
       {
         NitsTrace(
           PAL_T("loglevel parameter invalid; not setting loglevel"));
         NitsAssert(PAL_FALSE, PAL_T("loglevel parameter invalid"));
       }
       NitsAssert(PAL_TRUE, PAL_T(""));
     NitsEndModuleSetup

     NitsCleanup(OMITestSetup)
       NitsTrace(PAL_T("Cleanup of OMITestSetup being run"));
       Log_Close();
       NitsAssert(PAL_TRUE, PAL_T(""));
     NitsEndCleanup
