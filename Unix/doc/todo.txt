    (A) Add --httpsendtracefile --httprecvtracefile?

    (A) Handle <cim:Interval> and <cim:Datetime> on input.

    (A) Document enumerate instance flow.

    (A) Handling of large uint arrays -- standards issue.

    (A) UTF-16 XML support

    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

    (B) Use this:
            WSBuf_AddLit(buf, pd->name, NameLen(pd->code))
        Rather than this:
            WSBuf_AddStringNoEncoding(buf, pd->name)

    (B) Replace execl() with call to agent_main().

    (B) Single image (for server and agent) -- fork but no exec.

    (B) Test MaxEnvelopeSize in wsman tests.

    (B) Log messages with integer ids.

    (B) Preloaded providers.

    (B) Unauthenticated WS-Identify

    (B) Implement stubbed out MI.h functions.

    (B) Support single image for omiserver omiagent (same program but they
        run differently depending on contents of argv[0]).

    CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

    (C) Implement /etc/passwd authentication.

    (C) Generation of enums from Value/Valuesmap (separate files).

    (C) String array OctetStrings (no case for this yet).

    (C) Multi-threaded provider support tools.

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    (X) uint8[] octet strings.

    (X) Base64 encoder and decoder and tests.

    (X) WS-Identify

    (X) Synced with WMIv2 MI.h.

    (X) Added Fan profile provider (to show cross-namespace associations).

    (X) WS-Enumeration association filters.

    (X) Cross-compiler build support.

    (X) Added null initializer for MI_ClassDecl.owningClass element.

    (X) Added './configure --favorsize' option and CONFIG_FAVORSIZE macro.

    (X) Added various CONFIG_FAVORSIZE optimizations.

    (X) Added WSBUF_DISABLE_INLINING to gain 7 kilobyte size reduction.

    (X) Fixed provmgr bug with handling of INSTANCE conversion.

    (X) Fixed cimcli bug with argument encoding of arrays of instances.

    (X) Added 'server --httptrace' feaature.

    (X) Fixed bug with crash in stubs.cpp where associators stub crashed
        in Instance destructor. Fix was in Instance.cpp.

    (X) Fixed bug with <p0:InstanceID> parsing (wsmanparser.c assumed that
        property names are introduced by namespaces with single character
        XML namespaces).

    (X) Fixed bug with WS-Management Put: if property appeared in both
        selector set and in property list, the parser rejected the property
        list occurrence as a duplicate feature.

    (X) Fixed WS-Managed put-instance error: the parser was not accepting
        null properties. For example:

            <p0:MSFT_Person ...>
              <p0:Species xsi:nil="true">
              </p0:Species>
              <p0:Last xsi:type="cim:cimString">
                John
              </p0:Last>
              <p0:First xsi:nil="true">
              </p0:First>
            </p0:MSFT_Person>

    (X) Added wide-character support (see -character-support.txt).

    (X) Handling of null/empty uint16 arrays in C++.

    (X) Implemented chkshlib tool.

    (X) Accept PostResult from module Load and Unload.

    (X) Move to using ZChar and ZT internally.

    (X) Remove MI_ContextFT.Print function.

    (X) Implement PutResult with CIM error.

    (X) Implemented single image feature.
