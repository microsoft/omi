Errors of this type are principally associated with the procedures and/or processes required to convey information from one point to another. \n3 - Quality of Service Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with failures that result in reduced functionality or performance. \n4 - Software Error. Error of this type are principally associated with a software or processing fault. \n5 - Hardware Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with an equipment or hardware failure. \n6 - Environmental Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with a failure condition relating the to facility, or other environmental considerations. \n7 - Security Error. Errors of this type are associated with security violations, detection of viruses, and similar issues. \n8 - Oversubscription Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with the failure to allocate sufficient resources to complete the operation. \n9 - Unavailable Resource Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with the failure to access a required resource. \n10 -Unsupported Operation Error. Errors of this type are principally associated with requests that are not supported."
