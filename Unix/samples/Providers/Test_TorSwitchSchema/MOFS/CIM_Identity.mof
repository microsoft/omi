    Description ( 
       "An instance of an Identity represents a ManagedElement that "
       "acts as a security principal within the scope in which it is "
       "defined and authenticated. (Note that the Identity\'s scope is "
       "specified using the association, CIM_IdentityContext.) "
       "ManagedElements with Identities can be OrganizationalEntities, "
       "Services, Systems, etc. The ManagedElement \'behind\' an "
       "Identity is described using the AssignedIdentity association. \n"
       "\n"
       "Within a given security context, an Identity may be imparted a "
       "level of trust, usually based on its credentials. A trust "
       "level is defined using the CIM_SecuritySensitivity class, and "
       "associated with Identity using CIM_ElementSecuritySensitivity. "
       "Whether an Identity is currently authenticated is evaluated by "
       "checking the CurrentlyAuthenticated boolean property. This "
       "property is set and cleared by the security infrastructure, "
       "and should only be readable within the management "
       "infrastructure. The conditions which must be met/authenticated "
       "in order for an Identity\'s CurrentlyAuthenticated Boolean to "
       "be TRUE are defined using a subclass of PolicyCondition - "
       "AuthenticationCondition. The inheritance tree for "
       "AuthenticationCondition is defined in the CIM Policy Model. \n"
       "\n"
       "Subclasses of Identity may include specific information "
       "related to a given AuthenticationService or authority (such as "
       "a security token or computer hardware port/communication "
       "details) that more specifically determine the authenticity of "
       "the Identity. An instance of Identity may be persisted even "
       "though it is not CurrentlyAuthenticated, in order to maintain "
       "static relationships to Roles, associations to accounting "
       "information, and policy data defining authentication "
       "requirements. Note however, when an Identity is not "
       "authenticated (CurrentlyAuthenticated = FALSE), then "
       "Privileges or rights SHOULD NOT be authorized. The lifetime, "
       "validity, and propagation of the Identity is dependent on a "
       "security infrastructure\'s policies." )]

          "NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed "

          "similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of "
          "Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness "
          "<OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (\':\'). When using "
