# omiserver configuration file

##
## httpport -- listening port for the binary protocol (default is 5985)
##
httpport=0

##
## httpsport -- listening port for the binary protocol (default is 5986)
##
httpsport=0

##
## idletimeout -- idle providers unload timeout in seconds (defualt is 90)
##
#idletimeout=TIMEOUT

##
## loglevel -- set the loggiing options for MI server
##   Valid options are: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE (debug builds only)
##   If commented out, then default value is: WARNING
##
#loglevel = WARNING

##
## NtlmCredsFile -- credentials file for NTLM authentication
##
## To enable NTLM authentication via negotiation (SPNEGO), specify the
## location of the credentials file. This file is in the form:
##
##   <domain>:<username>:<password> 
##
## For further information, please see: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/master/Unix/doc/setup-ntlm-omi.md
##
#NtlmCredsFile=/etc/opt/omi/.creds/ntlm

##
##  Settings for omi-related directory and file paths.
##  You can modify below default path value to other location.
##

## omi log folder and log file
#logdir=/var/opt/omi/log
#logfile=/var/opt/omi/log/omiserver.log

##
## The cert and its private key for TLS/SSL communication
## pemfile -- The certificate to use for TLS/SSL communication
##     For pemfile, its owner is root user
## keyfile -- The private key that corresponds to the TLS/SSL certificate
##     To modify keyfile, make sure its owner is `omi:omi`:
##         run `chown omi:omi /yourpath/omikey.pem`
## 
#pemfile=/etc/opt/omi/ssl/omi.pem
#keyfile=/etc/opt/omi/ssl/omikey.pem

##
## This section is for security protocol settings
##   NoSSLv2: When it is true, the SSLv2 protocol is disabled.
##   NoSSLv3: When it is true, the SSLv3 protocol is disabled.
##   If NoSSLv2 and NoSSLv3 are both set to true, only TLS encryption will be negotiated.
##
#NoSSLv2=true
#NoSSLv3=false

##
## This section is for TLS enabled ciphers
## The prioritized list of allowed SSL/TLS ciphers. For example, set `sslciphersuite=ALL:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!TLSv1:!TLSv0:!CBC:!RC4-MD5:!RC4-SHA:!SEED-SHA` in `/etc/opt/omi/conf/omiserver.conf` to disable all SSLv2,SSLv3,TLSv1,TLSv0 ciphers and other weak ciphers: ##CBC,RC4-MD5,RC4-SHA,SEED-SHA; then run `sudo /opt/omi/bin/service_control restart` to take effect, for more information, check `man ciphers` or search internet with `openssl man ciphers` 
## Note : Disabling TLSv1 and SSLv3 on some older implemetation of openssl doesn't work well. In such cases, either update the openssl version or update the below sslciphersuite value accordingly
##
sslciphersuite=ALL:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!TLSv1:!TLSv0:!CBC:!RC4-MD5:!RC4-SHA:!SEED-SHA

# Enabling this will cause each provider to run under it's own omiagent
# process. This will take considerably more memory, but is useful for
# diagnosing omiagent cores due to a provider fault. Setting of `true`
# means that each provider runs under it's own omiagent process.

# List of authorized and unauthorized user groups, separated by commas.
# Both local and domain groups can be listed.  For example:
#    AuthorizedGroups=SCX\scx local admins, SCX\domain users, adm
#    UnauthorizedGroups=games
# If both parameters are blank (default), authorization checks are not
# performed. For more info, see
