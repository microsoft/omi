## NtlmCredsFile -- credentials file for NTLM authentication
##
## To enable NTLM authentication via negotiation (SPNEGO), specify the
## location of the credentials file. This file is in the form:
##
##   <domain>:<username>:<password> 
##
## For further information, please see: https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/master/Unix/doc/setup-ntlm-omi.md

## The cert and its private key for TLS/SSL communication
## pemfile -- The certificate to use for TLS/SSL communication
##     For pemfile, its owner is root user
## keyfile -- The private key that corresponds to the TLS/SSL certificate
##     To modify keyfile, make sure its owner is `omi:omi`:
##         run `chown omi:omi /yourpath/omikey.pem`
## 
#pemfile=/etc/opt/omi/ssl/omi.pem
#keyfile=/etc/opt/omi/ssl/omikey.pem

## This section is for security protocol settings
##   NoSSLv2: When it is true, the SSLv2 protocol is disabled.
##   NoSSLv3: When it is true, the SSLv3 protocol is disabled.
##   If NoSSLv2 and NoSSLv3 are both set to true, only TLS encryption will be negotiated.
##
#NoSSLv2=true
#NoSSLv3=false

# Enabling this will cause each provider to run under it's own omiagent
# process. This will take considerably more memory, but is useful for
# diagnosing omiagent cores due to a provider fault. Setting of `true`
# means that each provider runs under it's own omiagent process.

# List of authorized and unauthorized user groups, separated by commas.
# Both local and domain groups can be listed.  For example:
#    AuthorizedGroups=SCX\scx local admins, SCX\domain users, adm

# If both parameters are blank (default), authorization checks are not
# performed. For more info, see
