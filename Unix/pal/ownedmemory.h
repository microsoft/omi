* the memory allocation was done as part of shared library and there is no single exit point since atexit
* does not run upon its unload on unix systems
* the memory locations which were allocated will be kept till the end of program or till you call OwnedMemory_Free
* the memory will be in address space of PAL shared library on unix systems and non non-unix ones it will be part of anyone
