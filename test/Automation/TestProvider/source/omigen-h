OVERVIEW:
    This program generates provider source code from MOF class definitions.
    PATH is a file that contains the MOF definitions (or includes them).
    It must include any dependent MOF defintions as well (such as the CIM
    schema). The PATH is followed by a list of CLASSNAME arguments, which are
    the names of the MOF classes to be generated. Each CLASSNAME argument may
    be followed by an optional ALIAS argument (separated by an equal sign).
    The ALIAS provides an alternative name for the class to be used within
    the C source code. For example, 'CIM_ComputerSystem=CompSys' says to
    use 'CompSys' in C sources instead of 'CIM_ComputerSystem'.

OPTIONS:
    -I PATH                     Search this directory for included MOF files.
    -D                          Generate 'Description' qualifiers.
    -V                          Generate 'Values' and 'ValueMap' qualifiers.
    -M                          Generate 'MappingStrings' qualifiers.
    -S                          Generate standard CIM qualifier declarations.
    -B                          Generate boolean qualifiers.
    -Q                          Suppress qualifier declarations generation.
    -q                          Quiet mode - do not print anything on stdout.
    -h, --help                  Print this help message.
    -v, --version               Print the program version.
    -s SCHEMA                   Specify C name of the schema [schemaDecl].
    -n                          Suppress provider generation (only schema.c).
    --cpp                       Generate cpp skeleton for the provider.
    -d PATH                     Place output files in this directory.
    -l                          Generate strings.rc file.
    -f                          Set filter support flag into MI_Main().
    -A                          Generate single association function.
    -e CLASS                    Generate extra class with this name.
    -y NAME                     Use NAME as entry point (default MI_Main).
    -W                          Print MOF warnings (suppressed by default).
    -C, --schemafile PATH       Alternative path of main CIM schema file.
    -m PROVIDERNAME             Generate provider makefile.
    --nogi CLASSNAME            Set MI_ProviderFT.GetInstance to NULL for
                                the given class. This forces the provider
                                manager to use the EnumerateInstances method
                                to satisfy all GetInstance requests on this
                                class.

EXAMPLES:
    The following example generates a 'MSFT_ComputerSystem' class, which is
    defined in schema.mof.

        $ omigen schema.mof MSFT_ComputerSystem=CompSys
        Created CompSys.h
        Created CompSys.c
        Created schema.c
        Created module.c

    CompSys.h defines the 'CompSys' structure. schema.c defines run-time type
    information for the CompSys structure. CompSys.c contains the provider
    stubs and module.c contains the MI_Main() provider entry point.

FILES:
    .omigenrc
        This file contains an option per line as it might appear on the 
        command line (-OPTION [ARGUMENT]). These options are appended to the
        command line options, which take precedence. The program first
        attempts to open this file in the current directory followed by
        the home directory (given by the 'HOME' environment variable).
        The following is an example of the contents of this file.

            -I /opt/microsoft/sca/mof/cim222
            -I /opt/microsoft/sca/mof/extras
