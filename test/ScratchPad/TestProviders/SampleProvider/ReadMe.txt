    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : Provider Project Overview
========================================================================

In this is a simple provider that can be used as a template for creating providers on Windows.

Pre-req:
Build OMI.sln in Debug-Win32 configuration before using this project.

Notes:
This creates the Dll for the Frog provider and places it in the same folder as the omiserver.exe
It also places the reg file under OMI\main\distro\etc\omiregister\root#cimv2
